The activities of the members of Michael Collins' &quot;Squad&quot; were much  like those performed by Henry Smart, who was, in the novel, on the  periphery of possibly the most effective counter-intellegence agency in the  world.  Roddy Doyle's excellent novel captures the period as well as  anything I have hitherto read on the subject. He captures the feeling of  Dubliners towards the Easter Rising, before and after the executions, and  the attitude of those beyond the Pale (English-controlled region around  Dublin, where the phrase comes from) to the &quot;jackeens&quot;. Henry's  delay in leaving Ireland was, I believe, not as surprising as some seem to  think. Henry had great loyalty towards Michael Collins, similar to his  feelings towards James Connolly, a debt of honour, if you will, that kept  him from abandoning him while that was unresolved. After his betrayal and  the death of Collins, he was free to leave the country. These attributes  are visible in the character of Henry Smart, and are a major influence on  his actions. His various loyalties are strong and are probably the driving  force of his life.Before A Star Called Henry, I wasn't much a fan of  Roddy Doyle the author, preferring the film versions of the Barrytown  Trilogy, but I await with anticipation the remaining books in his latest  Trilogy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Roddy's Finest Hour", "unixReviewTime": 943574400, "reviewTime": "11 26, 1999"}

The &quot;hot zones&quot; (where the pointer changes to allow for an action) are a bit small for some items so it gets difficult to position the mouse over an object to pick it up.

There are a number of bugs that we found as well. Mickey starts slanting at a 45-degree angle at the pond if you have him repeat a few actions. Music cuts out intermittently at a few scenes. There's also a problem with some earlier revisions of this game and it won't load if your system date goes past 12/31/2000 (a fix was posted to the [...] website recently).

Pouring the water into the receptacle in the back is tricky with the last bit of water, it tends to get into the grounds part and leak down onto the heating element. Its most annoying feature: you can't turn the warming plate back on to keep coffee warm.  There is no way to keep the coffee warm without running a new cycle of coffee. And the clock can't be set going backwards so you have to push the button down over and over for each minute, and if its 12 hours off, it takes forever to set it. Annoying. The time delay brew feature is nice. The permanent filter has been easy to clean. It is a pretty noisy machine when it brews but I don't mind that at all. Its part of the coffee experience. I do like the blue display light and the stainless steel look. The coffee it brews is ok. I made it pushing the strong brew button tonight and didn't see a difference. Its an ok machine.

They are amazing on a plane with the exception of voices. Stewardesses, pilots and other passengers can be heard easily. I suppose it could be a good thing but I seem to prefer my old cheap Sonys to these as they cut out all exterior sound. Music and movies don't sound nearly as good but keep out 90%of all sound.They don't work unless the noise canceling is on (they have to be powered up to listen to them).  I find that while at home I would like to listen without noise canceling so I can listen for the phone, the doorbell etc. In a quiet environment I am not sure why they need to be on either. In any regard, it would be a pain to run out of juice on a plane trip as it may be difficult or impossible to recharge the battery and one would no longer be able to use their headphones. This is doubly bad since the batteries are proprietary. One would have to buy an extra set from Bose to guard against this possibility.The batteries seem to last a very long time (not sure how long but I left them on for at least 18 hours and they lasted another 1 or 2 with power remaining before charging). While these headphones are probably too nice to take backpacking or climbing it is not even an option for me as the battery could not be recharged. My preference would be to use AAA batteries. In my mind, it would be preferable as I would not have to worry about loosing a proprietary battery or charger and in the case of a long trip would not have to worry about the batteries running out.I have had several Bose products and I find that Bose does not play well with others. They often have proprietary connections etc. so that a consumer is locked in to Bose (I have also never had a lot of luck with their customer support although in their defense I always wanted their systems to work with other systems and they had little interest in that - they may be great with returns and service). These headphones appear to be the same. The cord to the headphones unplug from the headphones but the jack in the headphones seems to be an odd size. We have many headphones for our family and all the other cords are interchangeable. Not the QC3s. Probably not an issue but it may be that to replace the cord one would have to buy from Bose. In our house that may become an issue.The case that comes with the headphones simply stinks. The quality of the case seems fine but the headphones don't sit easily in the slots provided. If not placed precisely , the padding gets smashed and is uncomfortable for an hour or so (the padding comes back to form eventually).  I found an old case for another set of headphones that I use for travel and keep then in a drawer without a case at home. Small gripe but it seems bizarre to provide a case this well made for headphones this expensive that works poorly. Its like they had a bunch of cases for other headphones laying around. Rather than design a case for these headphones they simply used the old ones or share a case with other headphones they sell.These headphones were a gift. Before owning them I would have never considered buying them as my experiences with Bose have generally been bad (never the quality of the product, just that Bose will do everything they can to make sure you can only use their products when expanding a system etc.). Considering the other noise canceling headphones I have tried I would probably buy them anyway. They are comfortable, produce excellent sound and the best on the ear noise canceling I have found. My gripes are minor compared to that. If I found comparable quality in another set of headphones I would recommend them over the Bose QC3s. Given the choices I have seen I would recommend considering them if the gripes listed above are not big problems for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound, great noise canceling, the rest... not so great", "unixReviewTime": 1294963200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2011"}

One clue for me was that many of the sites chosen for examples are already among my favorite sites (Presto Studios being a conspicuous example).In my opinion web design books have suffered from one of two extremes: either they are so conceptual that there is no path leading to success for the novice site designer like my self; or they dwell so much on the technical, HTML-oriented side of web design and neglect the concept, storyboarding and other processes that lead to great content and presentation. This book balances both sides of the equation. Instead of miles of text instruction, this book simply says: &quot;this looks great, these are the things the site authors were going for, and here is how it is accomplished.&quot; The approach is very hands-on, yet more conceptual than technical (for coding there is no shortage of HTML manuals on the market). This book speaks to the artist in me, and inspires me to find the tools to use to bring my ideas to light, rather than the alternative equipping me with tools but without content direction.Above all, this book simply LOOKS great.

In the first text Twilight of the Idols, he offers a compelling attack on the prevalent beliefs of his time, including such thinkers as Hegel and Kant, as well as Socrates, theology, morality, and all things German. In the second text, the Anti-Christ, Nietzsche brilliantly and energetically provides his counter-arguement to Christianity and the ways the institution has distorted and murdered the teachings of Christ. His writing is breathtaking and his arguments are made in brief, explosive flashes of immense genius. However, his work can be exhausting as he continues to negate all thought besides his own, and his ability to draw references can be formidable.

This is a realistic story.Marnie had flaws, she was no where near perfect. She was real. I loved that about her. I was able to connect with her, but at the same time my heart ached for her.A Little Bit of Everything Lost is amazing. I couldn&#8217;t read and turn the pages quick enough. Stephanie Elliot did an incredible job at weaving between the past and present, in the beginning I wasn&#8217;t sure it would work, but it did. Thinking back on it now, I can&#8217;t imagine another way for it to have been written. The chapters switch back and forth showing us teenage Marnie&#8217;s life and her adult life, the way it was written, gave more depth to her character and let us know her on another level. I felt like we were best friends, like I had known her my entire life. I don&#8217;t think I have ever felt that way about a character before.This novel is thought provoking.

I had downloaded the first book in the series (Venus in Blue Jeans) as a freebie a long time ago and never got around to it as it's not my normal fare.  However, I spotted this one on another website and realized that it's part of a series, and every title sounded like fun reading--and oh joy,  I already had the first one!  I was in the mood for fun and different (for me) so I wiped the electronic dust off the first book and dove in and enjoyed it so much I immediately downloaded the rest.The first four Konigsburg books focused on four brothers who made their way to Texas from Iowa.  This one is number 5 and the main female character is the cousin of the female lead from Venus in Blue Jeans.  With all the intertwined characters I really like how the author pulls in the previous characters in a normal fashion.  A lot of times when reading a series like this the previous characters get minor and/or contrived cameos.  Here the old characters play big enough roles so you can get a real sense of what is going on with them (and that their Happily Ever Afters remain in place) but their presence makes sense within the context of the story.Another thing I noticed, and liked, is that the details surrounding the main story really keep the book a cut above the mundane.  Smaller town living, smaller town politics, Texas, vineyards, veterinarians as well as tons of fascinating minor characters really fill out the books.  The details really make the difference between run of the mill reading and something like this, which is just better.In any case, for a lighter read with a lot of fun and amusing characters this book fits the bill.  If  you haven't read the previous titles yet I would recommend going in order--things make just a little more sense in terms of the recurring characters (except one that that may have had a gender change somewhere in the writing...I need to go back and figure that one out...).  Oh, and for a 'hotness rating'  I suspect it is a little mild when compared to some of the other Samhaim published works... I would call this a strong R.  Details enough to know exactly what was going on, but not enough to overwhelm the story and the language was not too explicit.To sum up, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  (And I don't usually read straight up contemporary romance)JTG", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great read!", "unixReviewTime": 1292716800, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2010"}

These initial singular card issues were retailing (in the UK) at 2 and as Bear Family product is the best and NEVER sold cheap, not surprisingly these cute little tasters with their huge number of tracks and great sound got snapped up for the bargains they were. They were then reissued in jewel cases with proper booklets at full price once that initial offer expired (over 12).\"All We Wanna Do Is ROCK\" is another sampler in that vein - this time concentrating on Bear Family's highly successful and much-praised \"Rocks\" series and it's complimentary \"Rockin' Rollin'\" issues (over 40 CDs since 2002 and counting).Issued in the UK and Europe in June 2010, Bear Family BCD 17038 has 36 tracks, a gatefold card sleeve (no booklet) and clocks in at a mighty 80:27 minutes. It retails at 4 to 5 in Europe depending on where you buy it, so it will be a reasonably priced import in the USA.It is of course a mixture of the good, the great and the crappy. Not even the most liberal-minded Rock 'n' Roll fan is going to say that Pat Boone \"rocks\" - more like \"sucks\". And the teen pap that is Connie Francis' \"Lipstick On Your Collar\" - yuck!Both Cochran and Vincent are naturally included (their \"Rocks\" sets come out in July 2010) as are more Rhythm 'n' Blues based acts like The Cadillacs, The Treniers and Lloyd Price. Rock 'n' Roll is here too in the shape of Wanda Jackson (\"Let's Have A Party\" lyrics above), Bill Haley and Jack Scott. There's some Country with Charlie Rich (fabulous voice) and Conway Twitty. One of my favourites is the brill Screamin' Jay Hawkins track \"Little Demons\" which makes me laugh every time and also the fantastic 1956 remake of his 1948 break-through hit \"Chicken Shack Boogie\" by Amos Milburn - an absolute rockin' gem that's liable to make the dead literally get up and dance.Niggles - on the strength of this sampler, I was reminded that I had precious little music on two Rhythm 'n' Blues giants - Amos Milburn and Smiley Lewis. So I bought both. They arrived and I was suitably knocked out. Each of the \"Rocks\" issues has a 3-way card digipak with a 40 to 50+ page booklet featuring beautifully rendered 78's and 45\"s, concert posters, themed CD labels, clear tray with a suitable 7\" single pictured beneath, a biography on the artist peppered with pictures and even a detailed discography pertaining to every track at the end of the booklet. They are properly beautiful and of course given Bear Family's legendary excellence at remasters - they sound fab too. My point is that the gatefold card sleeve of this sampler gives no real indication of this - and it should. It would have been far better if this set had reflected the way the series actually looks. A 3-way digipak with a proper booklet, maybe sell it at 6 and act as a loss leader. As it stands, it feels like a magazine or a Sunday newspaper freebie - and that does \"All I Wanna Do Is ROCK\" a huge disservice. Genuinely - when you actually have one of the \"Rocks\" CDs in your hands, it's a thing of beauty.Still, I did buy two compilations because of it, so I suppose it worked...All in all, I urge you to check out this sampler - it's shockingly enjoyable. But as a music lover, be prepared to punish that credit card, because after the Amos Milburn and Smiley Lewis purchases, I'm now thinking I need at least 10 more of the titles listed below...In the vernacular, recommended Daddy O!PS: The \"Rocks\" Series by Bear Family features the following artists:1.

I certainly felt that way in this book. I refuse to give spoilers so you can experience the full effect of the story so I won't go into details of why I felt these things; but, you can rest assured I did feel it.  Second, the story itself was just different and well done. Lastly, most stories today seem to drag out or leave something open at the end so they can write sequels.

LOL Part of the reason is that, with the title, and subtitle, The Pram: A Baby Seeking Revenge, as I did, readers will more than likely guess what will be happening,.. It is so well written, however, that I even caught a hint of humor under it all...Or maybe I was enjoying the spoiled daughter and the attentive mother who was running herself ragged taking care of her daughter... Why do parents these days do that?!!! It sure didn't happen in my generation, nor in the author's, I'm guessing...Carrie had seen the pram at a second-hand store and immediately recognized the quality, knowing that the rich and famous, including Prince Charles, would have used this type of carriage... After a little bit of negotiating, Carrie bought it for her daughter's baby, who had not yet been born...Of course, her daughter immediately realized that it was old and second-hand--not anything like the new ones available, so Carrie offered to take it back. But it stayed long enough for her daughter to begin to like it...Which was fortunate, because she soon went into labor!But when Carrie had looked into the Pram one day, she saw a baby! Or was she crazy. Thinking it over, naturally, Carrie assumed that if indeed she had seen a ghost, then it was attached to the pram itself. So she went back to the shop to see if she could find anything out about the owner and return the pram! The shop was gone--empty of any business and clearly that way for a long time.The Pram soon went into the nearby river, with the hope that the ghost would stay with the buggy...It didn't... And then the baby started watching Carrie, as if wanting to be picked up. Carrie was the only one who knew anything about what she'd seen. How could she share it with anybody and not have them think she was crazy. Perhaps she was? How could she explain what she'd seem, especially since the shop was no longer there where she had bought the Pram...Could it get any worse? Oh yes, it could... Because it was quite clear that the ghost baby was there for Carrie! And then it spoke to her, wanting to know why Carrie had murdered her...Readers soon begin to pick up what was going on as Carrie tries to deal with the situation without talking to anybody else. She even took a trip back home, but found that only caused a different type of pain when she discovered her father was going into dementia and thought Carrie was once again 16--when it happened.She did, however, on that trip chance to meet the young man she had once been in love with... Even though they had once been good friends, she could not tell him what was happening to her...A simple love story that has been told over and over across the world of young love, torn apart when parents begin to make decisions for that couple. The story created by Betty Woodcock is not only horrible to consider because of the controversial issue that continues in today's world, it puts the spotlight on those children who never make it into the world. Do they wish for revenge? Quite scary to contemplate, isn't it?And if that were to occur...well, just try to get rid of it this time...Carrie certainly couldn't!Woodcock not only gives us a scary tale based upon real life actions, but provides a well-written story line that allows us to consider the \"what ifs\" while we tell ourselves, over and over, it's just fiction, it's just fiction...it's just...Horror galore in a simple small package... You decide because it may not be to your taste...Me, I thoroughly enjoyed it!GABixlerReviews", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Horror Novel Takes Readers Into Personal Lives...", "unixReviewTime": 1362960000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2013"}
{"reviewerID": "A1356EC2SQQL00", "asin": "1591430712", "reviewerName": "S. E. Moore", "helpful": [22, 35], "reviewText": "This is just one more of those glossy New  Age Jesus conspiracy books that titillate the curiosity but, in the end, leave you feeling empty because they're founded upon bogus research and the whims of the author. I consider the production of these books a racket. It is a falsehood that generates alot of money.  Legitimate, unbiased scholarship is not as lucrative.The authors of these books play this game called \"wouldn't it be neat if...?\"  For example, wouldn't it be neat if Jesus was a Pythagorean Gnostic Kabbalist who was trained in Egypt or India?  Wouldn't it be neat if Jesus and Mary Magdalene were secretly married and hid out in France so we could uncover this big Vatican conspiracy like in The DaVinci Code?I can't figure out if the authors of these books are gullible enough to believe their sources or if they deliberatey pull a con job to sell more books to a following that wants to believe this stuff.The only thing I can credit this author for is denying the Priory of Sion hoax perpetrated by Pierre Plantard which became the basis for Holy Blood Holy Grail and The DaVinci Code. However, he perpetrated alot of other myths.  Some of hs sources included the following:  Robert Eisenman, who believes Jesus was a god-man created by pro-Roman gentiles to undermine the Jewish resistance movement (forget about all the gentile Christians who were martyred by Romans);  the so called Akashic Record which conjures up Jesus in past lives  ie Edgar Cayce;  Ahmad Osman who suggested that Jesus could have been King Tut - OH PLEASE!!!;  Nicholas Notovitch who discovered that Jesus was in India and was considered an incarnation of Buddha (Buddhist monks later had a good laugh when they admitted to some tourists that they pulled a fast one on some westerners);  The Gospel of the Holy Twelve supposedly discovered by a clergyman who later admitted that it was given to him by revelation.  In other words, he made the whole thing up.The author was convinced that Jesus didn't die on the cross and he used the 8th century Quran and 9th century anti-Christian Muslim literature to try to prove his point.  Forget about the New Testament and second and third century testimonies of martyrs who staked their lives on their belief that Jesus died and was raised again.  This is an example of putting the cart in front of the horse.The author made sweeping assumptions without considering historical facts.  The author was convinced that Jesus was a gnostic and that the Nag Hammadi writings are more credible than the New Testament.  Most credible scholars would agree that the New Testament is much older than these writings and that the gnostic gospels were parasitic in regard to the canonical gospels.  This is another example of putting the cart in front of the horse.The author claimed that very few scholars believe that Peter was ever in Rome.  Clement of Rome, who composed one of the oldest writings outside the New Testament dated at the end of the first century, wrote that both Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome.  I'll take his word over these so-called \"scholars\".The author included the \"Nestorians\" among those groups who don't believe in the divinity of Christ.  The term \"Nestorian\" was given to the Holy Apostolic and Catholic Church of the East.  I have observed their liturgy and they revere the Apostle Paul and read his epistles as well as recite the Nicean Creed.  Saint Pachomius and the Coptic Egyptian desert hermits, who the author lauded in this book, were ultra-orthodox Christians and would be appalled at some of the claims made in this book.The author parroted the same tired old Paul and \"Paulinism\" versus the original Nazarene community in Jerusalem theme.  The Nazarene Christians accepted the apostleship of Paul and supported his mission to the gentiles.  I highly recommend Nazarene Jewish Christianity by Ray Pritz who did an in depth study of the Nazarenes based on the oldest and most reliable sources.  The so-called Ebionites who disparaged Paul didn't arise until the second century and were most likely the heirs of the Hellenist faction who Paul persecuted and were driven out of Jerusalem prior to Paul's conversion (see Marcel Simon's St. Stephen and the Hellenists in the Early Church).If Jesus survived the cross and hid out in France leaving his followers to suffer the most horrific persecutions for proclaiming him to be the risen Lord and Saviour, he would have been the greatest con-man and humbug who ever lived.  His disciples and other apostles, including James and Paul, would have been among the most gullible and stupid men who ever lived.Do you really believe that?", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "More New Age Nonsense", "unixReviewTime": 1224547200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2008"}

But she still runs out and kisses him like there's no tomorrow ( which there is not if they don't save the world).  *spoilers below*Some of my favorite quotes:****************************************&#34;Friends?&#34; Avian asked. His voice guarded. &#34; we'll get their&#34; west answers&#34;&#34;I didn't believe in soul mates, but I did believe in the better half of two wholes.

Sound quality wise these are probably in the $50-$75 range.  Much better headphones can be had for cheaper.

It cut out some noise, but because the noise cancelling works by introducing additional noise it actually lowers the overall sound quality of the headphone.

Nevertheless, I believe that after the last two years of  the McCourts putting forward one particularly scewed version of Irish  history, Doyle has now been lumped into the same category. This is  unfortunate because 'A Star Called Henry' is one of Doyle's most important  displays of writing to date. Every passage entrances and Doyle's gritty,  tough writing brings you into the story so that you are fighting beside  Henry, laughing beside him, and almost dying beside him as well. Doyle is a  very real writer, and although Henry may do some very surreal things in the  book, the fact remains that Doyle's honesty and knowledge of his own past  shine through brilliantly.

Caruso only lasted the one season, more or less (I believe at his own request), and the part of Andy's partner was then magnificently played by a true New Yorker, Jimmy Smits, who moved the part into an easily believable portrayal, including his own New York \"subtleties.\"Some (much?) credit should be given to Gordon Clapp for his performance as the somewhat less-than-self-confident \"Detective Greg Medavoy\" who, despite that, rises to the mandates of the police situations presented to him, to the point where Sipowitz in a later episode calls Medavoy a \"good cop,\" a true compliment coming from a seasoned officer.  Nice job Gordon.While certainly not a \"to be continued\" type of show, keep in mind that many of the episodes' story lines (but not all) are continued or referred to in the next episodes (much like real police work), and if you purchase a full season you'll find yourself not watching only one episode, but the next one following.

Won't you stay awhile? Catch up with familiar faces, and meet some new ones. Deidre Brandenburg has taken up residence in this little town, hoping to start a new life for herself instead of being under her father's fairly controlling days. In her mid-twenties, it's about time Deidre follows her own heart and dreams, even at the cost of Big John's angriness.Thank goodness Tom Ames owns the empty building that Deidre wants to use to run her coffee business. Problem is, she's got no access to major funds. Working for Tom seems to be the logical thing to do, though she knows nothing about waitressing. Things are really going to get interesting around this town, that's for sure!Deidre strives for independence. The stubborn woman doesn't want anyone taking pity on her, nor does she want help. She needs to do this on her own, to be on her own. After years of being under Big John's thumb and living ever so cautiously, it's time for things to change. Oh, they change all right. She meets her match in Tom -- he is as stubborn as she and doesn't accept help easily either. Their growing attraction to one another gets mighty intense. Both want to help the other out and have to learn to allow it, or their building relationship won't work.Enter an ex-boyfriend sent by Deidre's father and here comes trouble. Craig is up to no good and has an ulterior motive of his own. I spent the rest of this book wondering whether he was going to come between Deidre and Tom.Brand New Me is an engaging contemporary read full of emotions and wonderful characters that you can't help but love. I applaud Deidre for her quest to finally branch out and make a life of her own, and she stuck with it well, considering the financial strain and the lack of support from her father. In Konigsburg, she found new friends that welcomed her. She transformed from a stuffy woman in a suit to a woman who is able to let loose and open her heart to new possibilities. She and Tom are a perfect match. Ms. Benjamin really knows how to create memorable characters and put them through plenty of drama.If you enjoy a fiercely independent heroine who finally chooses her own destiny, a hero who would do anything for her, a small town full of unforgettable people, then plan your visit to Konigsburg.

The book is based on a study done by Jennifer Elam, a practicing clinical psychologist.  She did a participant observation study exploring the experiences of people who felt/knew that God was \"speaking to them\". The intersection here between a genuine experiential sense of hearing God's call along one's spiritual journey and what might be delusional/psychotic episodes is well described.  Dr. Elam notes that she is doing this study for \"personal reasons\", as she alludes tohaving experienced some personally dark emotional times. She also, however, sensitively shares and honors the experiences shared by her interviewees.I recommend this book for its careful exploration of the topic.

Anthony is a songwriter (as well as a writer) He is the founder director of a company, which is dedicated to education, healthcare and the arts. \"Chance would be a fine thing\" is Anthony's first collection of his poems.The variety of styles used by Anthony in his collection \"Chance would be a fine thing\" is commendable. In all there are 23 poems and songs; and these poems are on the topics ranging from Love to Politics and from Humor to Solitude... Some of the poems that I liked( or `loved', as you may) were:Some clocks tock upon the wall,Chance would be a fine thing,Untitled,Stand beside the one you love,Wanting,Cleaning windows,Long enough on the island,The poltergeist rap!,Side to side.Critically speaking the Poems and Songs written in the book are very well constructed, and it has some of the best verses I have ever read. The poem will make you smile but the message will (if not make your eyes moist) surely make you think (about lot of things; better not go in details :). But as they say with every good thing comes opposite... some of the poems were simply not for me. This maybe because of appreciation of art is very subjective factor and the ones I didn't liked might end up being your favorite ones.And so on concluding notes, \"Chance would be a fine thing\" by Anthony McCann is a very nice (and very tiny) book, which says much more than words it has.

Never has a miserably poor Irish childhood like Henry Smart's been described in more beautiful prose, replete with imagery of dead siblings reborn as stars. Henry Smart's boyhood in the dirty, crime-infested streets of Dublin is humorous, touching and often sad. Orphaned not by the death of his parents but by poverty and abandonment, Henry leads his younger brother Victor into a life of crime; hunger and desperation being their main motivation for `fecking' bread and killing cows with blades hidden in caps. The hard life led by the children is tempered with the tenderness the brothers feel for each other. Henry and Victor's attempt at `getting an education' is seriously funny, but the gaiety does not last long. Victor dies of tuberculosis, and this bitter experience shapes many of Henry's beliefs and ideals as an adult. By the time he is 14, Henry is a handsome young hulk in the Irish Republican Army. In the Army, he finds love, respect, but also betrayal. At once a love story and a history of the Irish Rebellion, `A Star Called Henry' is a novel that is all substance and no filler.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Genius Called Roddy Doyle", "unixReviewTime": 1064966400, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2003"}

To answer this, I really cannot say for sure other than I never ran a full scan of my computer before. I normally ran quick scans which do not scan all files. A full scan checks everything and is what found all of the threats mentioned previously. Also there were times in between subscriptions where I was not protected by Norton so it could have happened in either instance. Take my advice....Conducting a full scan of your computer using Norton Antivirus products is the Key!!!!!  I highly recommend it!

That wouldn't normally be difficult; however, the holes don't line up, so when you insert the bolt, it doesn't go through.

Also, where the holes are cut out in the pole to allow the bolts to slip through, they were not all the way finished ... i.e., the \"donut hole\" was still attached so when I tried to slip in the receiving part of that pole, it was obstructed. Had to break out the screw driver and hammer to hammer those donut holes off. Then, if I assembled it as instructed, I was to put a washer, then bolt, then washer, then nut; however, the bolt wasn't long enough if you use the washers. All in all, I had to toss the short pole, stick the second pole into the ground (but it has a narrow base -- so it wiggles more than it should) and flip the third pole around (so now the narrow end it actually on top so the eye bolt holding the tetherball doesn't quite fit right). Since I had already had everything unwrapped, spread out, unboxed, etc., and the shipping box is so heavy/long/difficult to handle, I opted for the jerry rig method as opposed to boxing it all back up and taking it down to be shipped and returned.

No description of historic events/times/places are written without the advantage of hindsight and, therefore, without opinions of what went down. This is true for both scholarly works (which this is not, of course) and fiction. When you mix fiction with facts and real people, you also run the risk of falsifying history to your readers: for someone unfamiliar with the time it is difficult to say what is fact and what is fiction.There are few uprisings covered in so many myths as the Irish in the beginning of the last century. The winner writes the history books and some facts become forgotten. Was Michael Collins a good guy or just a ruthless hood? Was De Valera a cynic or the great father of a nation? Doyle adds to the myth by relating the Easter Rising and the following years through the eyes of young Henry, a boy born and raised in Dublin's slum who goes on to become a killer for the Irish Cause-and for himself. He kills and he trains other to kill. All in all, not a very sympathetic guy. But Doyle lets him tell his story unbiased.Since I cannot see through Doyle's motives, I have to keep my distance when reading this book: I cannot allow myself to be &quot;sucked in&quot; in the otherwise very skillfully drawn environment. This is not pure fiction: I am certain Doyle wants to make a point, but I cannot fathom what it is. Surely he wants to say something else than &quot;people were very poor in Ireland and then there was a civil war&quot;. These nagging doubts kept me from enjoying the book, and that is not how it should be. Hence the &quot;only&quot; medium rating.I think the Barrytown trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van) was better since I did not have to worry so much about the motives when reading them. Sure, they are commenting and reflecting on the modern Irish society but the author's point of view is easy to grasp and, indeed, to sympathise with.Review written on St Patrick's Day, 2001", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I'm not quite sure what Roddy wants to tell us", "unixReviewTime": 984787200, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2001"}

I hurt my back last May and nothing was making it better.  Lots of drugs, but the pain wouldn't go away.  I was ready to try anything to make the pain stop.  I watched a show on National Public Television featuring Dr. Veejay Vad.  He is a back pain specialist and had a DVD offered for a gift to the station.  I ordered that, but while I was waiting for it to arrive (I really was in a lot of pain) I got the idea to do some looking around.  I found this video on Amazon.com.  I sure am glad I did.I ordered the DVD and have been using it almost every day since.  At first there were some exercises that I couldn't do without pain, so I skipped those.  Now I find myself being able to do all of the exercises pain free.  Well at least all the exercises that I can do, there are a couple that I am just not flexible enough to do in the suggested way.  That is not related to my back injury.  I am not a very flexable person.Again, this is a great video.  I really like it.  It is easy to follow and works for me on an emotional level as well as the physical one. I attrribute my current pain free (or nearly) condition primarily to usind this DVD.UPDATE;  11/5/11, I have been using this video for a few months now.  I can't say enough about it.  It has not only cleared up my back pain, but also discomfort that I had been experinecing in my hips and neck.  My neck, and back are more flexable, and stronger, now than they have been for years.\\UPDATE 10/16/12, I am still using this video at least 5 times a week.  I haven't had more than a twinge of back pain in so long I can't remember the last time.  And when I do have a twinge, its just that, a twinge and goes away.  I have also experienced many other benifits from using this video.  My neck and shoulders had been getting increasingly stiff.  I would notice it at times like looking behind me to backup the car.  No more.  I am stronger, more limber, and less uncomfortable than I have been for over 20 years.This video has enriched my life.  It has freed me from constant pain.

They were very good, but I had expected outstanding. What left me impressed was that my ears were only slightly red after 8 straight hours of music. One hour later, I put the QC3 on again for the next leg of my journey.Noise-cancelling: When I tried on the QC3 for the very first time, the first thing I thought was that it doesn't seem to cancel out high frequencies as well as the low ones. Putting them on for the very first time, with and without music playing, I was left thinking that only half of the noise was gone. In the Parisian subway system there are plenty of screetching sounds that still put the same chill up my spine as before. The good thing is that if the QC3 is well-fitted on my ears, it will cancel out most constant background noise so I can lose myself in my music.Audio quality: I detected only a small difference in quality between the QC3 and my $20 Sennheiser HD 202 headphones listening to Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring concert suite directed by Leonard Bernstein in MP3 format at 192kb/s. I didn't appreciate the lower frequencies in the QC3, which had lost some of their quality. Some of the low frequencies seemed to be missing.

{"reviewerID": "A15RZE7LOVMBOB", "asin": "0895770261", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [17, 17], "reviewText": "I decided to buy this edition instead of the newest one based on a blog post on Whipstitch Fabrics that said the newest edition cut out a lot of content.  After reading through a couple random sections of the book, I can see why some content may have been removed.  For example, in the chapter on tailoring, there's a section that walks you through how to handsew interfacing onto the undercollar.  For most home sewers these days, that is probably not the most relevant advice, since now we have fusible interfacing.  Of course, I can well imagine that the best results are still obtained with handsewing, and many serious sewers would get a lot out of those instructions, but the majority of hobbyists would probably not want to put that much effort into a collar.  At any rate, this book definitely bears the hallmark of a different era.  Whether that is good or bad completely depends on the needs of the reader.  If you are a casual hobbyist that just wants to make some fun projects every now and then, I imagine you would be better served by the newer edition that would cover all the new time-saving shortcuts that have been developed since the 70s.  But if you are a serious enthusiast or professional trying to learn all the different techniques to perfect your craft, then this book provides some really great insights that probably wouldn't be found in modern home sewing references.In terms of instructional quality, I am very impressed with this book.  All of the techniques are demonstrated in line-drawings next to the text, and very clearly convey the manipulations being done.  If you prefer photographs, the newer edition may be more helpful to you; but for myself, the line-drawings are more than adequate.  One aspect of teaching that this book does not cover is the theory.  It covers plenty of how-to's, but very few why's.  This could be frustrating to someone seeking a more in-depth education on sewing, but makes it a very good streamlined manual.The book is laid out very much like an encyclopedia, with techniques grouped by subject (e.g. seams, necklines, waistlines).  This makes it not very conducive to just sitting down and reading through it, as it's a bit dry and does not offer any coherent workflow; but it makes it easy to look something up.  It gives you all the different parts that are involved in making a garment, but does not really put it all together to teach you the process.  I feel that this makes it a great reference and teaching tool, but a total beginner is not going to pick up this book and learn how to sew.  If you are a beginning sewer, I would recommend you get a projects-based book to go along with this book, to give you a framework in which to apply the methods taught in this book.  But because this book contains so much technical information laid out in an easy to find way, it will never lose its value as a warhorse, and will grow with the reader.All in all, this book is a great tool for sewers, even though this edition isn't going to cover all the most up-to-date technologies.  But like all tools, its usefulness depends on the situation.  It's a great source for sewing techniques and the majority of information provided here is still highly relevant, despite the age of this edition; but it does not provide everything that anyone could possibly need.  New sewers will want to supplement this book with another that provides more overall direction, instead of just self-contained how-to's, and sewers seeking a complete understanding of the craft will want to look for something that delves deeper into the rationale behind these techniques.  It's probably also not a bad idea to supplement this book with a more modern reference that will cover the technological innovations since the 70s.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Old-fashioned approach, amazing knowledge base", "unixReviewTime": 1345075200, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2012"}

He has bones coming out the side of his boots instead of his knees and is nothing like the Doomsday from the &#34;Hunter/Prey&#34; toy set put out by &#34;Kenner&#34; which is in my opinion the best looking toy Doomsday you can get.I was hoping in size these would be a bit closer to the 1989 &#34;Toy Biz&#34; figures but they are shrimps in comparison. My biggest gripe is the Doomsday character which has the stature of an ape, short stubby legs and a huge upper body. Bone that should come from his elbows comes from his hand extending to his elbows and it's all wrong.  Superman looks neat a little beat up but they could have torn his cap some too, his cap appears to be untouched. All in all if you are looking for display they are not terrible and certainly no little kid is going to complain. However if you are like me and are looking for absolute comic book replicas look into the &#34;Kenner&#34; Death of Superman line. Much cooler figures.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "They don't make them like they one did", "unixReviewTime": 1371772800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2013"}

Set against this background two rival factions set about finding him and using him for their own ends. Not all time manipulations have the desired effect and there is an embedded warning not to tamper with time.There is a sub romantic plot and the background to the characters are nicely developed, it also deals with the relationship between a father and his daughter which is at times a wee bit tetchy.In all a book that has some good new ideas and worth reading if you like science fiction.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does start slowly", "unixReviewTime": 1368921600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2013"}

I own four of the Gilmour Flexogen hoses in various lengths and they are by far the favorites out of my entire hose stable.  Two of the hoses are nearing 15 years old and are still in excellent condition.  The Gilmour Flexogen hoses are the only hoses I have owned (and I have owned a lot of hoses over the years) that have rarely kinked.  They are very easy to wind on a hose reel or curl in a tight circle on the ground.  They are not that heavy - older people and ladies should not have much trouble managing 50 or 100 feet of these hoses.  My Gilmours are used on an outside well for maintaining a shallow pond and landscaping/vegetable garden. I had purchased the recycled Gatorhyde hose this summer instead of another Gilmour Flexogen.  The Gatorhyde hoses are nice in that they recycle materials, but are very expensive.  They are somewhat of a disappointment. I would rate Gatorhyde way below the Gilmour Flexogen hoses for two reasons: if you are not careful and unwind it in the direction it wants to go (and this must be done on a hot day to warm it up) it will kink, and although the Gatorhyde is fairly light-weight, it is a major hassle to wind. The Gatorhyde hose fights me every inch when I wind it out of the way for mowing or store it away for the winter.  It absolutely refuses to wind up in small neat circles without kinking, which is annoying, and takes up too much space in the barn. Whenever I need another hose, it will be the dependable Gilmour Flexogen hoses.UPDATE:  May 30, 2013  Found another gem of a hose, the Tuff-Guard Never Kink.  Bought the 100 foot length (bright blue is the only color for that size) and it is wonderful.  It DOES NOT KINK!  Rolls up compactly into small loops and is the lightest hose I have ever used.  Gilmour is still a fantastic product and I will continue to use my faithful Gilmour hoses until they wear out.

It then goes into the Cold War history of the Iowa class battleships during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the reintroduction of the Iowa class during the Reagan Administration's defense buildup of the 1980's. The explosion aboard the Iowa battleship could have had more coverage but was well handled.

If you were just to test each unit individually, you would be impressed by either unit but head-to-head, I noticed distinct pros and cons with each unit.The first thing you'll notice different between the two units is the styling. The Philips NP2900 is a very stylish looking unit with its metal construction, brilliant color LCD color screen and nice round corners which just looks sexy. Compared to the Logitech SqueezeBox Boom, with its plastic construction, more utilitarian green LED screen, bulkier square design and bigger size, the Philips unit just plain looks and feels better. The remote control on the Philips also looks and feels more like a hi-fi remote whereas the Logitech's remote is a small, simple remote that you'll probably lose pretty quickly since it's so small. The only real complaint I had with the Philips remote was that there was no page up/page down function makes scrolling thru long playlists a pain. Considering the backgrounds of the two companies, it was obvious the Logitech was designed with a PC in mind while the Philips unit was designed with more of a standalone, CE mindset.As for the setup, both units were easy to setup with each unit finding my Wi-Fi connection quickly and entering the WEP security key a breeze. I was up and running on both units within 5 minutes of unboxing them and was scanning for and listening to Internet radio stations with ease. Since I had them side-by-side, I tested the same Internet radio stations playing simultaneously on both. I had a few friends and family over so we all listened to each unit playing the same radio stations and compared the two. I then took a vote from the group of five to get their opinion for which sounded better. Everybody agreed including myself that the Logitech unit did sound better and on inspecting both units' speakers, you could see why. The Logitech unit had two bigger main woofer  speaker cones and two tweeters while the Philips unit had two smaller woofer speaker cones and no tweeter. The Logitech unit was also quite a bit heavier and most audiophiles will tell you that the heavier the amplifiers/speakers, the better the sound. This is not to say that the Philips unit sounded bad as it still sounded great and if we did not have the Logitech unit side-by-side, I am sure everyone would have been more than satisfied with the Philips' sound. Anyway, if you don't like the speakers, you can always plug your own in the back thru stereo RCA jacks or headphone jacks. Overall, the sound on the Logitech just sounded fuller with more bass and dynamic range.As for software, Philips comes with software from Twonky Media which turns your PC into a uPnP server so that the NP2900 can see and play music from your PC. The Logitech came with its own proprietary software that pretty much did the same thing. The one thing that the Logitech had that the Philips unit didn't was the ability to control the unit over the Web thru a standard browser. This was a pretty cool feature as you can adjust the volume and controls from the Internet on the Logitech unit whereas the Philips unit required using the remote only. For online services, the Philips let's you access Rhapsody but after the first month, you'll have to buy a subscription which is $12.99. Logitech can access Rhapsody for a fee, but can also access services such as Sirius and Pandora so it gives you more options in that regard. Since I really love the Pandora service, the Logitech gives me more options here.The bottom line is that both units are great units that most people would be more than happy with. Depending on what you want though, each unit is designed for different tastes. If you want a stylish, sexy hi-fi unit that is going to make your interior designer happy, the Philips unit is definitely the one. If you are more utilitarian and want the unit that sounds better and has more ways to control it, the Logitech unit is the one for you. As far as price, the Logitech unit is also about $75 cheaper so if price is a factor, the Logitech unit does everything the Philips unit does. If price is not an issue, then the Philips unit just looks hotter, almost like a piece of art.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Phillips NP2900 vs. Logitech Squeezebox Boom", "unixReviewTime": 1242000000, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2009"}

Prince William's own mother, Diana Spencer, was even more blue-blooded than Charles.

Anderson describes in detail the strategies she used in her relationship with William (wearing a provocative outfit in the student fashion show--which catches William's attention and leads him to invite her to become his roommate, ingratiating herself with the Royal family without overplaying her card, invoking William's jealousy during their period apart, and much more), while tracing William's training in the army, navy, and aviation.Overall, I thought Anderson did a good job with this.

However it is not without its drawbacks. Most of these are caused by modern equipment and devices that were not even dreamed of when X-10 was designed.When it works, it can be wonderful. But the X-10 powerline signaling mechanism was designed in the late 70s. This means it predates switch-mode power supplies (which are universal in home computers and laptops, are used in most modern \"power bricks\" and \"wall warts\", and are also used in much other modern gear), WiFi, compact fluorescent lamps, LED lamps, UPSs, and even surge protector power strips.Most of the above types of devices generate noise on the power line, and this noise can interfere with X-10's signals.Others actively *filter out* the X-10 signal. It is important to understand that the X-10 signals are sent during the \"zero-crossing\" period of the AC power waveform. They are weak (low voltage) signals well outside the AC power frequency range.In other words, when seen in an otherwise pure AC waveform, X-10 signals look like noise! So the noise filters in things like \"surge protector\" power strips, and even in much electronic equipment, will therefore reduce or even eliminate the X-10 signal! It's not their fault - it's what they're *supposed* to do.And the more surge protector strips you have in your home, the worse this gets. Note that this does not apply only to the equipment that is plugged into the power strip. It also will likely apply to stuff plugged into the same outlet as a power strip, or even to nearby outlets on the same circuit.As a result of both increasing numbers of electrically noisy devices, and increasing numbers of \"surge suppressor\" power strips, X-10 has been getting less and less reliable over the years in many users' homes. This has nothing to do with the X-10 modules or controllers. They're the same as ever. It's the other stuff in our houses and this is only going to get worse.You can have a setup that works perfectly most of the time... and then mysteriously starts ignoring signals from one particular controller. Or one module will start ignoring commands. Later it will just as mysteriously work perfectly again. In my experience these problems are usually caused by a \"noisy\" device, like a laptop with a particularly noisy power brick, that is plugged in or switched on sometimes and not at other times.Moving the affected controller or module to another outlet - especially one on a different circuit - will sometimes help, sometimes make the problem worse. Occasionally, *adding* a particular appliance or lamp to the house will make X-10 work *better*. And so it goes.Conclusion: For X-10 to work is no longer the \"slam dunk\" assumption it was decades ago (yes, decades!) when the system was introduced. If you want much more reliable home automation you're going to have to go to something else, like Z-wave. Of course that will be much more expensive, but... life is full of those tradeoffs.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "X-10 works fine when it works.

This book is really adorable, super fun and probably going to be loved by the pre-school/early elementary kid crowd! It's a how-to book for young children who want to be the best babysitters for their grandpas; they learn how to greet, feed, walk and entertain their grandpas while acting as grandpa-sitters. Also, it's the story of a little boy being babysat by his fun and loving grandpa. It's funny and clever, and both kid and adult readers will probably find it amusing.Although it's a short book, being for young children and all, the author is still able to give the characters a lot of personality. The little boy has a big imagination, and he's rambunctious, spirited and kind while the grandpa is warm, caring and willing to be a little silly and goofy with his grandkid. The boy's love of playing pretend was a great touch, and I liked how he included his grandpa in his games, showing young readers that grandparents can be a lot of fun too.The illustrations are very well-done, and every time you read it, you can pick out things you might have missed before. My favorite little detail is the inclusion of a pair of conniving little lizards who don't like the grandpa. If you wanted to add another element to reading the story aloud, you could easily play I-Spy-The-Lizards if you were reading this book with a child!This book is an awesome book for any kid who is going to be staying behind with a babysitter, but it is an especially good book for grandparents to read with their grandkids or perhaps for teachers to read on grandparent visitation days.

That is due to the fact that a trip to Julie Kenner's website revealed no plans for a third installment.  She said she hopes one day to finish Beth's story but there are no real plans to do so.  I hate stories that end in a cliffhanger about as much as I hate TV shows that end on a cliffhanger and then aren't renewed for the next season.  Yeah, that's bad.  But being a huge Kenner fan and also a Beth fan, I had to pick up this book.  I am both tremendously glad and sad that I did.  This story picks up right after the first one.  Beth is a vampire who is also in line to be her class valedictorian.  Due to being tricked by the football team and forced to drink blood, Beth is now a blood drinker.  Someone out there is her master and Beth needs to find out who it is.  If she can kill her master, than she can become human again.  She has to do all this while trying to avoid getting staked because someone is after her.  It may be her boyfriend Clayton, who she had to turn recently to keep him from dying.  Since she is his master, killing her may be Clayton's only hope of becoming human again.  This easy to read story literally flew by...every page is packed with action and Beth's adorable wit.  This is a strong, fun teenager, and a great example for pre-teens and teens to look up to.  For adults like myself, it is still a fun read.  The sad part is having to wonder how Beth's story will end.  \"Good Ghouls Do\" left a ton of unanswered questions.  It would be nice if Kenner could find some way to wrap these up?  If there is no chance for a final book, perhaps she could work Beth's conclusion into a short story in an anthology or something.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent- but will there be a conclusion?", "unixReviewTime": 1230076800, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2008"}

Of the Art of Fugue too, even played on string quartet, but now I MUST hear this monumental music by the Delm&eacute;'s!).The playing of the Delm&eacute; Quartet is really celestial, without the fallacious stereotyped sweet-shop beauty of old, realized by excessive tremolo and unnecessary portamento passages between notes, from which even many famous modern ensembles are still not entirely exempt. Their style is elegant but, what is more important, it is dignified and intelligent.What I don't fully agree with are secondary statements. The first sentence of the review could be said about Schubert as well. \"Biedermeyer note-spinning\" is a lucky expression but Biedermeyer is not necessarily bad. Brahms is sometimes not far from it, eg. in his Clarinet Trio, or even in his first Cello Sonata, however great it is otherwise. Hummel's Cello Sonata may not be great but it does not lack beauty.While it is not untrue that \"this composer's music is disconcertingly uneven\", and more so than usual, one must admit that only the music of a handful of exceptional composers is not uneven: perhaps Bach's, Haydn's, Brahms'... As to the main point, \"[Hummel's music] at its best is as good as anything among works in the canon of the \"standard repertory\", it is absolutely my own opinion too.These were only nuances. But the slighting of Hummel's piano music frankly dumbfounds me. Hummel's most \"exalted height of musical splendour\" is precisely a piano sonata, the titanic F sharp minor, and there are other astonishing pieces, like the Fantasies Op. 18 and 123 (anticipating Schumann and Liszt, by the way, but not astonishing because of that), magnificently performed by a Madoka Inui with a perfect feeling of their character, or the not titanic but on the contrary \"Biedermeyer\" op. 92 for four hands. A Rondo brillante Op. 109 and two (actually one single) Pot-pourris Op. 58 & 59 are also captivating, in spite of the little convincing quality of the available performances, which don't bring into relief the true sense of these unconventional works. I suppose that among the many other unrecorded solo piano works several are worth unearthing, as well as among the various pieces of ballet and pantomime music with tantalizing titles like The Magic Ring or Harlequin as a Spider, or Der Zauberkampf (The Magic Fight).I don't understand why the sleeve-notes, which are or should be an important source of information for the layman, can't avoid humdrum wisdom. Like here: \"Hummel's String quartets ... were composed in the wake of Beethoven's revolutionary Opus 18 Quartets.\" The author is evidently an expert. Another expert, John N. Burk, writes in his book on Beethoven: \"Certainly no one, even Beethoven, could have borrowed that elegant investiture of a closing century and worn it with the consummate grace of those two [Haydn and Mozart] who made it so completely a part of their natures ... The texture, at its best, is richer ... But the old-time air of formal correctness hang over them ... There are moments when one asks whether the composer of the piano sonatas Opus 10 and 14 has relapsed into cautiousness...\" etc. Now one wonders which of the experts is right. Revolution or old-time air of correctness? I guess that he who says revolution, just like he who sais that \"Hummel links Mozart to Chopin bypassing Beethoven\" and the like, can not be right since such talk amounts to say that 4 is the link between 3 and 5. Truisms can be not only insipid but also untrue. Beethoven = good. Revolution = good. Therefore Beethoven = revolution. I feel on the contrary that, whichever of the two sets, Beethoven's or Hummel's, is greater, with respect to the spirit (as opposed to the compositional element) Hummel's is more original, less \"in the wake of\" Haydn and Mozart, and not at all in the wake of Beethoven. But the main point is that a composer is not great because he obeys to the rail schedules of music history or runs faster than the train.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Running faster than musical history", "unixReviewTime": 1301788800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2011"}

I have to say, I really liked this book. It is not for everyone though, as you can see by other reviews. It is vulgar and hard to follow at points, but in my opinion these things only add to the wildness of the main character who I found fascinating.Henry is a licentious and rebellious person who cannot get enough out of life and seems to be running around causing trouble throughout the entire book. I cannot relate to him at all, but that is part of the fun. It's a wild ride, but it also teaches you a lot about the main players and events of the Irish War of Independence. It also shows you the absurdities of war, and that in war there it is nearly impossible to determine who is good and who is bad.Some might say Henry is full of himself, but to me it seems like he just has a really good idea of who he is, and isn't afraid to let you know. I think it is also a survival technique -a person living in constant danger needs a lot of self confidence to live. He also seems to be about double his age throughout the book, which I think can be attributed to the fact that he grew up in poverty and had to grow up fast.There were moments when I considered putting it down for another book, but I'm glad I stuck with it because at the end of it I was thoroughly satisfied and looking for my next Roddy Doyle book to read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A little crazy but very intelligently written", "unixReviewTime": 1250899200, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2009"}

It appears that they are.I live in a one-bedroom apartment approximately 15 minutes away from campus, and having the ability to switch off the lights from my Android phone and iPhone saves me some time when I head out of the house to class in the morning.  (I run a low-power Atom/Ion-based server with X10 Commander, connected to an ActiveHome Pro module)  I do enjoy that I can shut off the lights from anywhere to save money on my expensive monthly electric bill (since I live by myself, $50/mo feels unacceptable).I'm a bit of a nerd, so I try to offset the electricity I use with my home theater (I often forget to shut this off/put it in sleep mode), gaming rig (in standby most of the time), and my appreciation for brightly lit rooms when I'm doing problem sets late at night (low-K compact fluorescents and halogens only).I've learned that in lamps with shades (even with CFLs), the Socket Rockets work great.  The Lamp Module works great with my halogen desklamp.  But for the LED strip lighting I put over my sink (no switch, since I use a RadioShack power supply!) I needed the AM466.  Ditto for any gooseneck lamps, since the socket rocket makes the bulb protrude too far.  If you put many varieties of CFL on the lamp modules, they will flicker and buzz horribly.  Dimmable CFLs do NOT work well with the lamp modules, since while dimmed, they introduce line noise which renders them uncontrollable.As for reliability, one Socket Rocket failed to program/function until I screwed it in very hard, bending the contacts inside the unit into place.  I also had an issue with a specific code and a specific AM466 in my house, but I resolved that by numbering it out of sequence, changing it from A9 to A13.  I can't figure out what exactly caused that issue.  Lastly, the keychain remote has pretty good range, but one of my credit card remotes is basically useless.The frustrating thing about X10 (since it's not built into appliances) is that if you control a lamp or appliance from X10, you cannot also control it by its built-in switch.  Hence the remotes.That said, I won't consider an alternative, since the prices the competition charge make home automation out of my price range.  Also, the ubiquity and old age of X10 means that there are random projects that support it, i.e. Mac and Linux support if that's what floats your boat.In conclusion, go with X10, but don't expect a flawless experience unless you want to spend more.

Of special interest to Sardines readers, may be his excellent revised version of the libretto for the first of Ivor Novello's eight spectacular musicals, Glamorous Night (1935), in a way that makes it accessible for companies today.Working on that, directing the celebratory 50th Anniversary Concert of Novello's life and work at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and acting as the Novello consultant on Robert Altman's Gosford Park, not to mention contributing to the BBC documentary Novello The Handsomest Man In Britain, has led to David developing a special bond with the ghost of Ivor Novello and his world.  It has served him brilliantly with his two, well-researched biographies, of both Novello (In Search of Ruritania) and his contemporary Lily Elsie (Anything But Merry!)David has an amazing gift for bringing back to life the bustle and allure of London's West End in the days of Daly's, The Gaiety and beyond; above all, the personalities who illuminated them whose charismas have very inadequately been captured by recordings. The DVD of Novello in the 1932 film of his play I Lived With You gives, perhaps, the best idea of his light, comedic touch; whilst only a few scratchy, mono recordings survive of Elsie's glorious voice.To women of my mother's generation Novello was a god.  Even if they'd heard - and then, understood - the rumours that he wasn't actually romantically involved with Gladys Cooper et al, but had a male partner, (though the word `Gay' was not used then) and bedded just about any attractive young man within his orbit, they brushed it aside, worshipping him for his looks, glamour and unique brand of escapism.  The book sheds more light than ever before on the bohemian world of Novello, Coward and their contemporaries in a way that is both chatty - yet scholarly.He makes a good case for Novello being the Andrew Lloyd Webber of his day, his popular, personality-dominated fare `filling the plush', making London theatre less elitist and available to a wider social spectrum than ever before.  And he truly captures the soul of the man. The atmospheric description of his visit to Novello's house Redroofs in Berkshire, is particularly moving.At last one has a good idea of the real Novello, freed from the damaging airbrushed portraits of earlier, sentimentalised biographies. The man was full of contradictions. For all his apparent chutzpah and charm, he had a depressive side, and despite a normally good business head, could be amazingly nave and head-in-the-sand, as when he found himself with a prison sentence during WW2 for accepting illicit petrol from a fan.Novello's soaring waltzes and ballads set to Christopher Hassall's romantic lyrics are, for me, a bit like Belgian truffles: two at a time are bliss, more a bit rich. But this is not to knock Novello's fine musicianship and range as a composer, which includes a wide variety of songs and music that has been shamefully undervalued and neglected. It didn't help that he died at the peak of his powers, aged 58, in 1951, after arriving home from playing the lead in his own Kings Rhapsody. Concurrently with that show at The Palace, his other musical Gay's the Word was running just up the road.  This was a very different cuppa, with clever lyrics by Alan Melville showing Novello returning more to the witty revue style of his earlier years - whilst gently sending up, not only his own Ruritanian shows, but Oklahoma! and the new wave of slick American `musical plays'.What might he have done next?  Would he have been able to move with the times, or become a dodo - as Coward and Rattigan almost did before they were both rediscovered?  We shall never know.The adolescent Novello was a huge fan of Lily Elsie who made her name as Lehar's `Merry Widow' in 1907, going on to star also in A Waltz Dream, The Dollar Princess and The Count of Luxemburg. She later appeared opposite him in his play The Truth Game (1928).  Older by then, but still very attractive, it was to be her final stage appearance.You'd have thought such an incandescent performer would have been blessed with a fulfilling life.  But she was riddled with demons, tormented by stage fright and even her hoped-for happily-ever-after with a handsome, wealthy husband, ended in tatters. In the 1950s she had a lobotomy in an attempt to save her fragile mental health, but it only helped destroy her personality further. Nevertheless, Anything But Merry! successfully evokes the world of the Edwardian operettas and musical comedies, and reminds us of the life of one of its glittering, yet sadly forgotten performers - and the sometimes incalculable price of fame.For more information on David Slattery-Christy's plays and books:[...]'Book Ends' Review by Raymond Langford-Jones for Sardines Theatre Magazine - July 2013", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sardines Theatre Magazine - July 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1376697600, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2013"}

As others have noted, the burner valve control is not very sensitive and takes careful turning to get a low flame.And it does seem cheap - Coleman is only relying on their name now as this is not the robust product of old. The sheet metal is thin but decent quality, but the top lid hinges are cheap and on one side is flexing outward from the rivets.It's probably fine for most, but priced too much for a product of this lower quality. $29 is closer to what I think it's worth. Not sure what to recommend for better quality, but if want something a bit sturdier I'd be inclined to spend a few more dollars or search for another product.UPDATE Sept 01 2012. After 5 nights camping I am returning the stove .. the gas valves are hard to adjust to a low flame (as others have noted) and there valves have \"spring back\" too. Another camper had the \"Coleman PerfectFlow InstaStart 2-Burner Stove\" and the valves were not springy. I may consider that stove ... the BTU output of the stove is identical, the only useful difference is the better gas control.UPDATE Sept 22 2012. My return was processed. 5/5 stars for Amazon's return process - excellent and efficient. After more research I am considering the \"Camp Chef Mountain Series 2 Burner/High Pressure Stove\".

They are also by far the most comfortable, physically, of any head phones I have used. I used them for the first time on a 10 hrs intercontinental flight. I wore them during the entire flight, and only took them off occasionally just to feel the difference in background noise. I will never go on a flight without them again. I plugged them into the aircraft's sound outlet for the movies, and I only had to bring up the volume to a minimum compared to what I had to with the airline's own head phones. You can use them instead of earplugs. But they're quite expensive if noise cancelling is all that you need...But for daily use, it's a bit too bulky, and you're always worried that you will loose them.

Self-Cleaning Freestanding Electric Convection Range in Stainless Steel (Model MER7765WS) in March, 2011. It works great, overall, and I love the dual heating element selections on the stove top. Temperature control on both the oven and on the stove top is good, and it's been easy to keep clean.Now to the bad parts... The oven handle finish - which is also supposedly stainless steel - has already worn away to expose the gray plastic that it's actually made of. Whatever the anodized finish over the plastic handle is made from, it can NOT be stainless steel.  We don't even use the oven too much, but the finish is completely worn away on the right side of the handle where we grab it to open the oven.I just replaced the handle (search online for part #W10171750) for about $50, hoping that the new one will be more durable than the one that came with it.  Both the old and new handles appear to be made identically, so I don't have high hopes for it, but time will tell.Back to the good: The convection oven bake feature is great! Put crinkle cut fries or \"Tator Tots\" on a pan with convection bake and the baked fries come out nice and crisp - almost like they were fried. Spray some sliced potatoes with olive oil and seasoned salt and they come out better than anything you can buy!The glass stove top is also nice.  Easy to clean, and the single/dual heating elements on the front two burners are extremely handy. We make a lot of stuff in big stainless steel and/or cast iron pots (like big pots of soup/stew that simmer for hours) and the flexibility to move pots around on the stovetop is great.Everything has held up well over the first year except the finish on the oven handle. It seems a bit ridiculous to need to replace a \"stainless steel\" handle after one year because the \"stainless steel\" finish has worn off to reveal the plastic underneath.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice range but finish durability is suspect", "unixReviewTime": 1334448000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2012"}

They also talked about dinosaurs I had never heard of before like the Buitreraptor.  I had also never seen the Microraptor before.  I thought it was cool that they showed how big a dinosaur was compared to a person.  When I saw the picture of the Argentinosaurus, I thought it was an elephant with no face. I also didn't know that a T-Rex's tooth makes a good knife.My favorite dinosaur is the Ankylosaurus because it's cool how it has spikes and a hammer tail thingy-ma-jigger.  My second favorite dinosaur is the Triceratops because it's cool how it has giant horns and a shield on its head and it's funny that it has a mouth like a beak.  My third favorite is the Stegosaurus because it's cool how it looks like it has leaves on its back.  My fourth favorite dinosaur is the T-Rex because it's the biggest meat eater. My fifth favorite is the Edmontosaurus because they can make a stampede when there's a bunch together running.There is nothing I didn't like about the book.My bottom line:I loved, loved, loved this book.  I would recommend it to little boys my age or 6 years old.MOM SAYS:What I liked and disliked about:For followers of our reviews, you'll note that this book was featured as one of the selections in the Children's Non-Fiction week of our Summer Reading Weekly Book Giveaways. Well, Lo and Behold! What should we spot on our latest visit to the library but National Geographic Kids: Dinosaurs! :DWell, my son and I got pretty excited when we saw this book and did not fail to deliver! As mentioned by my son above, we have read several dinosaur books, but I would rate this one at the very top.  It provides the right combination of real photographs of Paleontologists digging up fossils of dinosaur bones and coloured illustrations of 15 different dinosaurs representing the well known (e.g., T-Rex, Triceratops) and some we had never run across before (e.g., Microraptor, Anchiornis).But I think that what really sets this book apart from other dinosaur books that we've read is that there seems to be just the right amount of information.  I find that most dinosaur books have so much detail about each dinosaur that it is quite easy for kids to quickly lose interest.  In this book, they provide very basic facts about some of the more popular dinosaurs:\"Tyrannosaurus rex (ty-RAN-oh-SORE-us REX) was one of the biggest meat-eaters that ever walked the Earth.Triceratops (tri-SER-a-tops) had a huge head with three large horns and a wide neck frill.Anklylosaurus (AN-kye-loh-SORE-us) was an armored dinosaur. It had a solid bone club at the end of its tail.\"Oh, and can I just say that I appreciate the help with the pronunciation of some of these beasts?  Well, that just might be the French in me with all the funny accents in the wrong place coming out!Interestingly, when my son was discussing his favorite dinosaurs above and the reasons why they were his favorite, these are exactly the features that he remembered. Further, with regards to the information provided, there are unique scientific facts about dinosaurs presented in this book and they are presented in very simplified, easy-to-remember ways.\"Dinosaur Skin: Sometimes dinosaur skin left prints in mud. The mud hardened and saved the prints. These fossils tell us that some dinosaurs were scaly, like lizards. And some dinosaurs had feathers, like birds. [PHOTOS  AND ILLUSTRATIONS PROVIDED].\"Worthy of a quick mention is that there is a glossary of some of the terms used in the book at the very back: extinct, fossil, museum, and Paleontologist.  Nice touch!My bottom line:My son and I really, really, really enjoyed this book.  For his age group, I would say that this is THE dinosaur book.  I would recommend it to young dinosaur lovers aged 4+.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My son and I say it's the best dinosaur book we've read!", "unixReviewTime": 1346716800, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2012"}

There is the inevitable love interest, but it never gets tacky like in 'Grey's Anatomy.'Although the show depicts New York in the 1990s, the whole show is in no danger of feeling outdated. Crisp writing, thoughtful plots and some very neat camera work keep the action rolling and the characters totally plausible.It's my favorite series after the early ER shows, because it shares quality, tension and a great feel of realism.

It gets tricky when its flying left or right and not very aware if its flying away by gusts or winds or coming towards you.It can be flown outdoors on light moderate winds, more than that and this copter will pick up altitude in a flick of an eye. You can kill power in mid air, let it drop and it will recover over a nice hover immediately. I had read it was good for outdoors, my V911 flybar heli has a fight on even the slighest wind, I am on my 3rd as I already lost two. Wanted to do some flying outdoors without breaking the bank and the EZ fly was a perfect choice.Very durable, have crashed it a few times and have not broken any parts yet. I highly recommend to fly on a park when you are learning as it WILL go fast when hit with gusts of wind.

It has literally ended my disabling back pain quickly on more than one occasion.I started having episodes of severe back pain shortly after giving birth.  I had multiple specialists and exams.  The doctor was willing to give me lots of pain meds, but they just dulled the pain a bit for a couple hours and then I was in even worse misery.  I got this video as a desperate effort to avoid back surgery... it worked.I've had this video for several years now and I feel like I should be sending this woman a payment every time I use it.  I've got from having constant, immobilizing pain to occasional episodes (like once a year) that clear up within a couple uses of this video.I had been in a lot of pain this last week-- unable to bend over or stand up straight or roll over in bed-- and nothing was helping.  I found my \"Back in Shape\" dvd and popped it in.  After about 20 minutes of the video, I could stand straight again and bend with minimal pain.  Just finished day 2, second time through session 1, and I have almost no pain.  I'll used it a few more times in the coming days, and then it will go on the shelf until I need it again.It's an incredible video and I hope you'll try it if you have back pain.  I never in a million years would have thought it could be so effective so quickly.Thank you!  Thank you!

The citizenry of a blind, unconditional following democracy are potential pawns to tyrannical zealots. .When individual moral conscious, is replaced by fear of repercussion, where constitutional guarantees are eroded by supreme executive powers and orders of a politic, the seeds of dictatorship are sown.These were fractional examples of the rise to power of recent histories human nightmares - National Socialism and the Gestapo.The culmination of horror at the behest of diabolical, fanatical, self serving narcissists, led millions to their deaths, and untold millions more to dehumanizing torture, conquest, and subservience, as one political party enslaved the greater portion of the world&#8217;s democracies.This book is an in-depth study of extreme political science, and should be considered a paradox to what we now teach in modern sociology.Highly recommend this book to any person whose genuine moral conscious is to preserve the absolute divine dignity of humanity; to teach present and future generations of their obligations to liberty, freedom, and justice; and additionally to those whose ambitions compel them to seek elected leadership.The terrible legacy of National Socialism portrayed in the tremendous book forced this reader to often put the book down for a while, since it sickened this reader as to how low multitudes of monsters could passively endorse multi-continental  genocide and slavery. It also reaffirmed that history will repeat itself, unless today&#8217;s generations are educated, and are resolved to avoid the dibolical advances of totalitarianism.The duplicity of political correctness clearly began with the Nazi Party. The ideology of plausible deniability was also spawned by the Nazi leadership, and greedy, prejudicial, and uneducated populations fell, hungrily, for these initial deceptions.People did not vote their conscious, they voted for Party and for superiority of doctrine. Through their complicity they were equally guilty of supporting crimes against humanity; their cowardice to fight for freedom cost them the unconditional surrender to the evils of dictatorial absolutism.This book should be a must read for sociology students, book clubs, and aspiring politicians. Through them history may not repeat itself.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A frightenly disturbing anthology past history.

They continue themes he had developed in his earlier work, and \"The Anti-Christ\" especially approaches Christianity with a particularly ferocious and critical eye.As anyone who has thumbed through a volume of Nietzsche can tell you, his work isn't composed of clear, well-defined propositions to be ultimately accepted or rejected; instead, his arguments have a kind of ravishing rhetorical force to them.  His writing is less apothegmatic here than in other work, but is still never syllogistic or ratiocinated in such a way that we usually associate with philosophy.  This isn't a mistake; he intended his work to speak as much if not more through the force of style than anything else.  In his \"attack\" on Socrates in the first book, he calls reason itself a \"tyrant,\" and wonders if Socrates enjoys his \"own form of ferocity in the knife-thrust of the syllogism.\"The greatest part of \"Twilight of the Idols\" is the chapter called \"Morality as Anti-Nature\" in which he says that all moral systems up until now, and particularly Christianity, are wrong precisely because they try to deform and reshape human nature to their own image.  For Nietzsche, the moral is the natural, but Christianity - and this is really an attack on all religious systems, though some more than others - stops being moral when it tries to impose concepts that are completely foreign to human beings like the idea that \"everyone is created the same\" or a selfless Christian charity.  Whether or not you agree with the thrust of the argument, I found the idea of moral systems as rational attempts to remold nature an interesting one.  Of course, people jump on these passages to try to make him look like some kind of nihilist or immoralist, when nothing could be further from the truth.  He simply wants the principles and drives of human nature to inform ethical systems, not something foreign to them.  Freud may have picked up on this, admitting as he did a great debt to Nietzsche.  \"The Anti-Christ\" goes on to attack what I would call religious psychology, and especially the moral precepts of Christianity.If you haven't read Nietzsche and have some sort of caricature of what he says in your head, start with this book, probably one of his most readable, which is ironic when considered in the light of his mental breakdown immediately thereafter.  His attacks are never the ones you hear from atheists these days, that \"the idea of God is irrational\" or \"we have no scientific evidence for such a being.\"  His criticisms are fresh and invigorating, including accusations that the apostle Paul distorted Christ's message beyond measure and that Christianity focuses on another world essentially devaluing this one.  Again, this isn't about agreement or disagreement with his basic assertions.  (Some of the people on whom he had the biggest influence fundamentally disagreed with what he said.)  It's the punch that he packs while delivering them.  There was a reason why he subtitled the book \"Wie man mit dem Hammer philosophiert\" (\"How to Philosophize with a Hammer\").Other than Nietzsche's writing itself, some of the most impressive things about him are the downright preposterousness of the criticisms that people levy against him, the sheer width and breadth of intellectual laziness with which people read him.  Just from reading a small sampling of the reviews posted on this book alone, there are accusations of him \"deriding self-control\" and being \"obnoxiously right-wing,\" the first a willful misreading, the second a risible attempt to foist a set of anachronistic political opinions on the ideas of a man who was hugely contemptuous of the German politics of his own day, left and right alike.  Those who are trying to discover their token protofascist in Nietzsche would do better to look elsewhere, especially at his contemporaries Paul de Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, all of whose ideas make Nietzsche's supposed illiberalism look like mere child's play (for details, see either Fritz Stern's marvelous \"The Politics of Cultural Despair\" or my review of it posted on this site).  That Nietzsche still serves as a lodestar around which people feel free to hang their own various political opinions can only be a testament to his continued cultural importance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "How To Philosophize With A Hammer", "unixReviewTime": 1339027200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2012"}

Namely, that the writer's duty and privilege is \"to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.\" And that the writer must rid his workshop of everything except \"the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.\"What must have really motivated Edith to write the article in the first place, and which she had too much class to mention, is that Faulkner lifted these ideas for his Nobel speech, and the very words, from Edith's own 1936 book \"Spokesmen for God.\"But that aside, the main point of the article is her masterful and illuminating analysis of Faulkner's art and placing of it in context.

Here is very short summary of the comparison thus far:Noise cancellation:Bose:  9 out of 10Senn:  8 out of 10- It appears that QC3's slightly better noise cancellation is due to the better sound isolation of the ear padding itself and not necessarily due to better noise cancellation electronics.Audio quality (low-frequency):Bose:  9 out of 10Senn:  7 out of 10- Bass quality is definitely excellent on the QC3.Audio quality (high-frequency):Bose:  5 out of 10Senn:  9 out of 10- If you listen to a higher quality audio source such as a CD, you can definitely notice the loss of definition/clarity in the Bose QC3 headset.  Senn's high-frequency response is excellent.Comment/conjecture: Because of attenuated high-frequency reponse, it appears that Bose has targeted the QC3 for the 128 Kbit MP3/WMA market.  As anyone who has tried to listen to a 128 Kbit MP3/WMA on a high-fi audio system (and was terribly disappointed in the results) can testify, having faithful high frequency reproduction of a 128 kbit source is a liability and not an advantage.  QC3 makes my MP3 player sound better than on the Sennheiser because QC3 better hides the high frequency harmonic distortions of the 128 kbit source.For me personally, the high-end clarity is much more important than the low-end response so I am disappointed in the QC3 (which is why I gave it only 3 stars).  However, for those who want great noise cancellation and listen to mostly medium quality audio sources, QC3 may be a perfect fit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Noise cancelling good,  high frequency response poor", "unixReviewTime": 1198713600, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2007"}

It's a novel about 4 sisters set in the late 1800's.  The sisters are raised by a single father, who is a doctor.  Don't worry, I didn't need to give a spoiler alert because you get this information in the first few paragraphs of the book.  After you find out the situaiton with the mother, the book quickly shoots ahead 17 years to a time when the sisters are young women.  It's a story about their lives and love and relationship.  Oh, and flirting and discovery and some confusion and hurt.Throughout the book, the women talk about their belief in and relationship to God.  As a believer and follower of God, I find myself drawn to Christian fiction.  I love a good story.  And, even though these fictional characters lived in a different time and generation, they faced some of the same challenges and relational struggles that we face even today.  They wanted happiness and love, just like women of the 21st century.I really like to read nonfiction but every once in a while I like to read something mindless and just plain entertaining.  So, if you're looking for a light-hearted story that will, at times, keep you guessing then I will suggest The Bridegrooms.

The life of an  IRA volunteer is unromantically and realistically portrayed in all its  bloody carnage. His language is eidetic and at times mesmerizing (which  saved the 4 stars). There seems to be a tendency, though, to present Henry  as a personna while keeping the person a mystery. Other characters are left  fustratingly oblique.

Eight-year-old Vada virtually grew up overnight and raised her three younger sisters while her father lost himself in his medical practice in the basement of their home.Now, Vada is a grown woman, still making her home with her father and sisters. Her days are spent serving as an errand girl for Cleveland's fledgling amateur orchestra.Dizzying change occurs the day the Brooklyn Bridegrooms come to town to play the Cleveland Spiders and a line drive wallops the head of a spectator. The fan is whisked to the Allenhouse parlor, and questions swirl about the anonymous, unconscious man.Suddenly, the subdued house is filled with visitors and Vada's sisters are giddy at the bevy of possible suitors. Vada's life is awakened amid the super-charged atmosphere of romantic opportunity.This book is an easy read; from the beginning, Pittman grabs your attention. If you're female, that is - I don't think this is a \"guy\" book by any stretch of the imagination.I found myself comparing this story to Little Women frequently.

Tanveer Hussein loses.  His assailant, Epi Dalmau, flees.  Epi's brother Alex, a medicated schizophrenic, witnesses the killing, as does Salva, the bar's owner.  Rumors spread around the barrio about the cause and perpetrator of the assault on Tanveer, all of them wrong.  As the story progresses, glimpses of the past alternate with snatches of the present, providing clues to Epi's motive for attacking Tanveer. That Tanveer deserves to die becomes increasingly apparent as his violent life is revealed, yet Epi seems an unlikely assassin.The story drifts from past to present, from one damaged character to another.  Whether they are central to the story or playing a bit part, the characters are unique and unforgettable.  Tiffany Brisette, Tanveer's girlfriend, is driven by the need to feel empowered.  She thinks she can control the game when she's with a man because she's the only one who knows they're playing a game.  Her sister Jamelia, a little slow and befuddled by life (and by far the novel's sweetest character), is convinced that God will eventually punish Tiffany for being mean to everyone.  Aging part-time sex worker Roc&iacute;o Baeza just wants to stay alive while she supplements her family's income.  Allawi, like barbers everywhere, is the barrio's central repository of gossip.Carlos Zan&oacute;n writes with insight and sensitivity about hopeless and forgotten lives.  His characters are incapable of planning or of achieving goals because in their lives \"one thing knocks away another, like in a billiards game.\"  Their aspirations are simple -- a stable relationship, a job, a good life -- but unattainable.  Although they seem destined to make bad choices, it's not clear that good choices are ever available.  They are prisoners of their own fatalism.  They live together but they are alone, \"their hearts withered by solitude.\"The barrio itself is virtually a character.  This isn't the Barcelona of fashion models, art museums, and trendy tapas bars, where happy tourists play on white sand beaches.  It is a gritty place where dreams shatter like the windows of abandoned cars, a locked warehouse that isolates the poor and the mentally ill and the drug addicted, a place where the criminal underclass allies with the Arab immigrants who are shunned elsewhere.Zan&oacute;n's powerful prose builds and maintains teeth-clenching tension as the story moves to a conclusion that the reader will both anticipate and dread.  It seems inevitable that at least one luckless life will end tragically, yet the final chapters leave room for the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps.  Some readers will dislike the uncertainty, the feeling that the novel isn't quite finished, but I appreciated the respite it offered from the sense of impending doom that pervades much of the story.Although I loved The Barcelona Brothers, I recognize that many readers will not.  If you are looking for humor and warmth, look elsewhere.  If you do not like a book unless you like the characters, if you believe fictional characters should always learn lessons or experience moral transformations, this is not the book for you.

I was moved to tears several times, yet could not stop reading.  Most of us have had at least one failed relationship that has marked us, scarred us, shaped us, or in some cases - ruined us.  It is hard not to compare subsequent relationships against \"the one\" or to wonder about the \"what ifs?\"  Our heroine suffers from personal trauma that has her conjuring up memories of her first love, which only causes her further turmoil and self-loathing.  The story goes back and forth in the timeline, but it usually correlates and ties in well due to the unresolved issues that tie in to her present day concerns.  I was engrossed in this story.  It was extremely well written, insightful, and realistic.  It brought back many memories of how youth feels... the highs, excitement of new love, sexual and personal discovery, freedom... as well as the hangovers, the idiocy, naivety, and the insecurities.

I decided to ask my father (who really knows nothing about audio or headphones) to do the same side-by-side comparison without telling him what I thought, and he agreed as well and he didn't think it was close.This was a big surprise to me- I have heard some 'audio elitists' complain about Bose sound quality, but I really thought at a retail price of $350 they wouldn't sound like garbage.My recommendation is to take that $350 you'd spend on these and buy the Senny 595s for $180 (great for home listening, but not noise cancelling and not in public), the PXC 250s for $90(pretty good noise cancelling, way better sound quality) and a little dot tube amp for $80 or so.

During one of Kei's conversations with Kanzaki, we learn a little more about what happened after the accident that involved Suwa and Kei.  Kei also throws a surprise birthday party for Kanzaki.  Next is the school athletic meet, where, unbeknownst to Kei, Suwa is visiting Saito and watching the events.  This is followed by Kanzaki discovering that Suwa has dropped by his apartment for an unexpected visit.  Kanzaki ends up having to keep that visit a secret from Kei, which starts to add some tension and strain for Kanzaki to deal with.About halfway through this volume, six months have progressed since the beginning of the series.  Hidaka has made some subtle changes in the designs of some of the teenage characters to reflect this passage of time.  Outside of that, though, this volume has the look a reader has come to expect from this series.  I also noticed that Hidaka also seems to be relying on some of the manga tropes that she had really backed off on in Volume 3.  However, how Hidaka utilizes these tropes really helps to emphasize what's going on.  One of my favorites is how Hidaka uses a lightning background, combined with the expressions on the faces of Shinogu and Rion, to depict how much they dislike each other when they first encounter each other at the beginning of this volume.What I've really been appreciating about Hidaka's writing style is that she reveals just enough new information in each volume of the series to keep the reader satisfied, yet leaves enough details unanswered to make the reader want to read more to find out what other information will be revealed in the next volume.  In a lot of ways, it's like peeling away the layers of an onion; just as you peel away one layer, you discover there's a new layer waiting to be peeled back.  When I reached the end  of this volume, I really wanted to be able to read Volume 5 to find out what information, twists, and turns will be revealed.  If you've read and enjoyed the previous three volumes of Tears of a Lamb, then I think you will enjoy this volume as well.Tears of a Lamb is rated \"T\" for teens.I wrote this review after my older daughter checked out a copy of this manga volume through the King County Library System.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "More twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader's interest", "unixReviewTime": 1316304000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2011"}

(Check out Fireside's large print Librosario for that; it is what I would call &#34;comfortable,&#34; rather than &#34;large print.&#34;) There is a decent basic Catholic dictionary, but no maps at all. Since it is a NABRE it does come with the usual hit-or-miss notes, which are collected at the end of each book. It is too big to cart around, and too nice to risk dings. Despite its humongous size, the font seems on the small side, but I read two chapters of Isaiah today without problem. It is in an unusual three-column layout. Between that, the small font and large pages, the book of Ruth is only two pages! (Coincidentally, I found a 1961 Bible where we had RCIA class tonight, and it had the same layout.) The paper is real, thick, gilt edge book paper, so you don't have to worry about thin Bible pages. It has two ribbons, which is really nice. One for your couple study and one for your personal reading.It comes in a substantial slip cover with St. Peters stamped in gold. The cover is beautiful, thankfully not the Jesus portrait so often found on family Bibles. Just a striking red cross with a gold tile design near the edges of the cover. The spine is decorated, and tastefully incorporates the NABRE trademark. Although I believe it is bound with glue, there are ridges to suggest an heirloom. It looks and feels impressive, and Catholic.There are lovely color sections on The Mass (without one instance of the word &#34;sacrifice,&#34; unless I overlooked it); Parenting; Grief and The Vatican; as well as children's stories and activities for Christmas. There is the customary portrait of the reigning Bishop of Rome, and a list of all his predecessors. The various sections provide appropriate traditional and modern prayers, which I thought was nice. There is an excellent family record section, with places for eight kids. (This is a Catholic Bible, after all.) It goes back to your great -grandparents, and also has lines for things like military service, organizations (say, Benedictine oblates), and even papal audiences! It is so well done I'm inspired to fill it out, once I figure out how to write on slick paper without making a mess.Bibles like this are more likely to be owned than read, which is somewhat of a shame. I would guess most are purchased as gifts for parents or grandparents. (I received mine as a gift.) But it shall rest next to my favorite chair and be employed in daily lectio divina. It's just too nice to put away. There's just something about turning the pages of a large, beautiful book. Even better when it's Holy Scripture.So, in conclusion, it's a really big, very beautiful Catholic Family Bible suitable for devotional reading unless larger print is necessary. The extra material is more &#34;fluffy&#34; than scholarly, but of decent quality. Any Catholic adult should be pleased to receive it as a gift, and proud to display it in their home. The color sections are all useful in the family setting.St. Corbinian's Bear -- see you at my blog", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Nice Family Bible", "unixReviewTime": 1392249600, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2014"}

Jacques Delarue is the author. He was a member of the French Resistance. In this book he briefly recounts his imprisonment by the Nazis in a terrible French cell in a page. . Many of his friends were executed by thge Nazis. Delarue is a brave man and a fine writer.The Gestapo was ghd Secret State Police of Nazi Germany (Geheime Staatspolizi.) This horrific instrument of terror was begun by Hermann Goering one of Hitler's right hand thugs. It later came under the hegemony of Heinrich Himmler the cruel head of the SS and Gestapo. The Gestapo controlled all police functions in the Reich. Delarue spares no details as he examines the Gestapo and its many agencies designed to exterminate the Jews from Europe; control the German people through terror and infiltrate enemy nations through the use of espionage and spying activities. The Gestapo tortured and murdered millions of people in the name of the Fuehrer Adolf Hitler and his criminal regime.The book has many cogent quotations about this infamous time in human history. Among them:\"The best recruiting agents of the Party were the soldiers. They also formed the cadres of the S.A. transformed by Roehm into a veritable army which very soon threatened the government and exceeded the Reichswehr itself in numbers and power.\"-p. 6\"By the spring of 1934 sixty-five thousand Germans had left their country...They fled from an insidious terror which now bore a name; the Gestapo.\"-p. 23\"...there is very little doubt that the Reichstag fire was lit by the S.A. on it's initiative and at the instigation of Goebbels, the author of the plan, with the complicity of Goering,without whom it would have been impossible.\"-p. 53. The reviewer notes that this assertion has been challenged by later historians.\"His subordinates would say later that Himmler never meted out praise or blame...He loved secrecy; he impressed it deeply  in his creations, making it an absolute rule, any violation being punished with exceptional severity and sometimes with death.\"p. 68\"...from the age of ten, the young German was subjected to a continual obsessive barrage of Nazi propaganda and ideology.\"-p. 80\"The task of the Gestapo was to prevent all discussion of Nazi dogma, to eliminate by no matter what means the opponents, even those who dared to doubt the excellence of the regime.\"-p. 84\"...the two classic elements of Nazi action; terrorism and police inquisition for the liquidation of opponents.\"p. 161\"Born in violence,nourished upon crimes and horror for twelve years, Nazism slowly collapsed in ruins and blood, dragging a whole nation down in its death throes.\"-p. 336While outdated the book has become a classic in the study of the Gestapo.

In essence the author attempts to wrap all these organizations (except the Abwehr) up in his treatise and by so doing loses focus on the Gestapo for an in-depth study, if indeed that was his original intention.For the reader looking for new material in this work, he should be advised that there is none since the original date of publication.  In addition, on almost every subject covered in this book, there is a superior work now out that goes into much greater depth and is more definitive than this.  For the Gestapo, Butler's work would be recommended, although it is not the last word.Nonetheless, for someone unfamiliar with the repressive Nazi sub-organizations, this book would work as a reasonable introduction.  The author follows the Gestapo and its personnel in France somewhat more closely than elsewhere, but even in this limited area the author fail to provide sufficient coverage.  Werner Best is given seven references in the Index, none of which are pages containing his name (he is developed lightly on page 132), and Klaus Barbie fails to appear at all.The author spends a great deal of time on external events such as general affairs concerning Hitler's actions, military and political developments, the Stauffenberg attempt on Hitler's life and various resistance activities.  Here the author's prejudices overwhelm the reader -- he has no use for the German officer corps and dismisses the officers in the July 20th plot as cowardly, and indulges in speculation concerning their motives which he also disparages.  Only in his portrayal of personalities does the author have truly something to offer, and his sketch of Heydrich is worth reading to understand the type of person attracted to the dark side (assuming that it has a light side) of the Nazi regime.In short, if you have never read a book on the Gestapo, then, OK, read this one for starters, but always keep in mind that some of the author's information is severely dated, sometimes not completely accurate, has been extended and enhanced, and invariably much more completely analyzed in other works than here.  If you already know a fair amount concerning the Gestapo, SS, SD, etc, then pass on Delarue's work for something more contemporary and detailed.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dated, Good Personnel Analyses, Lacks Focus", "unixReviewTime": 1221523200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2008"}

As I read Breen and other missional authors/practitioners I have to remember that they are pioneers to a large degree because they have found some traction in the way they do church.  However, and Breen qualifies this, it's hard to capture how they got that traction in a book or books.  There are so many variables that seem to be in play these days that it is hard to define and address each one and put it into some coherent strategy.  Breen does his best to give his readers something tangible to hold onto without making it too mechanistic or overstated.  Where I really got some good help was Breen's emphasis on &#34;letting God do the work&#34; and &#34;trying to hear God, then obeying what you hear.&#34;  I think both these concepts can be abused if not explained, but Breen does a good job explaining them.  We have defaulted so much to a formulaic way of doing ministry that we think ministry and discipleship really depend on ourselves (i.e. &#34;Becoming Contagious Christian&#34; by Mittleberg literally has a formula in it).  Breen does a good job or getting his readers to embrace a more God centered approach to ministry, which, while refreshing, is much more demanding of our lives.  I may not embrace all of Breen's interpretations of the Bible (i.e. he thinks Paul's thorn was the Judaizers), but there is room for interpretation on the stuff he brings up so it is fair.  In the end, I think you have to have some of Breen's stuff while reading others practitioners like Cole, Halter, Roxburgh, Frost, Hirsch, etc.  They all offer insights in this difficult time for the church.  As I say that, I get this sense, that the real answers for folk who want a better church lie in mostly studying the life of Jesus and trying to become like him.  He focused on the kingdom of God, the reign and rule of God on earth as it is in heaven.  He emphasized that to live under God's rule means loving God and loving neighbor and then teaching others to love God and love neighbor (great commandment and great commission).  I believe that if we all just did a little better of trying to understand and adhere to these main concepts of Jesus, then we will all experience the movement of God's kingdom.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "insight for the journey", "unixReviewTime": 1378166400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2013"}

So, I do lot of reading and really couldn't take that much travel without myBose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesto listen to my iPod, including sleeping with the headphones. My first QC-2 broke at the left stem a bit less than a year, but Bose replaced them with no questions asked. The second QC-2 lasted for a bit more of two years, completely worn out, and officially pronounced death when the left stem broke again. So I was facing the decision to go again for the QC-2 or switch for the QC-3. The smaller size of the new model was key for going for the QC-3, but I was very concerned about the recurring breaking of the left stem  in any of the two models.I came to the QC-3 Amazon reviews for advice. I found several useful reviews, but the review entitled \"QC-3 vs. QC-2 (side by side comparison)\", dated July 12, 2006, is really outstanding above all, this is an excellent and thorough side-by-side comparison of both models. Even though that review was fundamental to make my decision, I still have four unresolved issues, so I decided to go to a BOSE store to try both models (sorry Amazon). Because the salesman promised me to exchange them for the other model within 30 days, I ended up buying the QC-3, and so far I am happy with my decision. So, after four months of almost every week air travel, I want to share my experience, mainly, regarding these four issues:***Sound and noise cancelling***I am no sound expert, so I left that to any of the good reviews below. When listening music from my iPod at a decent volume level, the QC-3 allows you to enjoy the same virtual sanctuary as the QC-2, not only from the jet engines, but from cabin noise, and even your neighbors' chit chat. With my new QC-3 I realized how much I was missing this level of tranquility. Besides, the smaller ear cups are much more comfortable, particularly to sleep, with the same sound quality and noise cancelling.***Alleged ear pain***As reported by some fellow Amazon reviewers, ear pressure from the more pro-active noise cancelling of the QC-3 was a key concern. The signal to cancel out the noise is stronger on the QC-3 to compensate for the smaller ear cups. The salesman confirmed this. So far, I have not had this problem at cruising altitude, which often is 6 to 7 hours long. However, my ears have always been very sensible to changes in air pressure during a flight, particularly at the beginning and during the descending phase, so I do get a minor ear pain, but the pain did worsen very often with the QC3. Sometimes the pain has also happened when climbing to cruising altitude. Fortunately, descend almost coincides with the time to turn off all electronic devices, so it became more of a wake up call for me. Anyway, the sales guy said they were not aware of this problem, but I had the 30-day trial to exchange them for the QC2 if the problem arises. I rather enjoy the comfortable smaller size, so I decided to live with this small inconvenience and kept the QC-3. I strongly recommend you do ask for the trial period, clearly this issue depends on how sensible your ears are to air pressure.***Batteries***I rather prefer to have a spare battery just in case I do run out of juice in the middle of a long-distance flight, as you do with the QC-2. And a spare for the QC-3 will cost you an extra 50 bucks. Since I went for the QC-3 without the spare, so far I have been getting at least between 16 to 18 hours. So, now I am not so concerned about the rechargeable QC-3 batteries, and you can charge it on any regular plug. Furthermore, even for a frequent air traveler like me, the promised 500 charges should be enough for several years.***Tear and wear***I was very concerned about the QC-2 breaking at the stem that attaches to each earpiece, particularly the left one. It happened to me twice in three years. The salesman told me BOSE is aware of the problem, and both the QC-2 and QC-3 have a new reinforced design to avoid the problem. However, he warned me of being more careful anyway, so his advice is to use both hands to take them off, as you should do with your eyeglasses. Well, my glasses always get loose and twisted, and I take them with one hand, so I think he might be right. The stem reinforcement might not be enough if you don't treat your headphones as they deserve and accordingly with the price you pay. So far I have been trying hard to get used to take the QC-3 with both hands, but by instinct I tend to do it with one hand, and now that I am aware of the problem I have no doubt a one-hand pull produces lots of torsion on the left stem since I am right handed. I will report back to you with a PS if the left stem breaks before a year on the QC-3.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Superb product, but watch out for the breaking left stem and ear pressure", "unixReviewTime": 1208736000, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2008"}

David Bochco insisted that ABC allow him to use minor profanities and brief nudity to create a more realistic portrayal of the lives of New York City cops.  While several stations balked at the show and refused to carry it, the show was an instant success.  What really made the show so interesting was not the language or nudity, but the well written shows and first rate acting.  Bochco veteran Dennis Franz plays alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, who was only supposed to be in the first episode, whose character is gunned down and nearly dies.  Mr. Franz is superb as the volcanic Sipowicz and was rewarded with the first of his four Best Actor Emmys for the season, but the real star of the season is David Caruso.  Mr. Caruso is simply magnetic as Sipowicz's partner John Kelly.  Whereas Sipowicz is a hot head, Kelly exudes cool and calm.  He is passionate about what he does, but his anger boils beneath the surface where Sipowicz's explodes.  It is this dynamic between the two that makes the pairing work as one of the best in TV cop show history.  Other cast members include Sherry Stringfield as Assistant D.A. Laura Michaels who is also Kelly's ex-wife, Amy Brenneman as Janice Licalsi who is a police desk officer that is tangled up with the mob and carrying on an affair with Kelly, James McDaniel as Lt. Arthur Fancy who heads the department and is black.  Sipowicz is also a racist which causes much tension between him and Fancy.  Nicholas Turturro is Dt. James Martinez who is a new detective who struggles for acceptance on the job.  Future series regulars, Gordon Clapp as Greg Medavoy, Sharon Lawrence as Assistant D.A. Sylvia Costas and Gail O'Grady as receptionist Donna Abandando all appear as recurring characters before all were made full time cast members in the season two.  Actors like David Schwimmer, Michael Rappaport, Wendie Malik, Daniel Benzali, John Wesley Shipp and Bradley Whitford have guest roles.  Season one of the show almost seems like a separate show all together due to the massive cast changes that occurred after the season.  Mr. Caruso believed all the hype about him and made the mistake many actors who achieve success on a TV show, that they can become movie stars.  Mr. Caruso left the show after four brief appearances in season two and never achieved the stardom that he seemed slated for.  Sherry Stringfield left the show after the season to go to another show that would be even more popular, ER and Amy Brenneman also left the cast.

This is such a strong issue today and is definitely a difficult subject to write about but Nicole Andrews Moore did a great job capturing the true aspects of domestic violence. I felt it was very empowering! There is help out there for those who need it&#8230;. You just need to look for it and be willing and ready.Not all domestic violence is to the extreme or even begins that way. It is a gradual process that will build over time until that person finally snaps and the victim is so far involved in the relationship it is hard to get out. My heart broke for Nina and all she had to experience with Shane. She cared so much about his well being but at the same time she had her daughter, Kylie, who had special needs to think about. She chooses her daughter and does what is best for her no matter how many times she questions some of her actions. I felt pride for Nina for taking a stance!Many times in these types of relationships you think the abuser will change and things will get better. You love that person and want the best for them but when do you finally say enough is enough???!!! You can&#8217;t change people; they must be willing to change themselves. Nina is a strong and confident woman and in the end she figures it all out!I hope that people remember that there is more than just physical abuse in relationships. You can also be verbally and mentally abused and if you ever find yourself in one of those types of relationships please seek help!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Taking a stand.....", "unixReviewTime": 1386806400, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2013"}

She must also be the confidant to her father lovingly called Doc.By day she was the errand runner for the Cleveland fledgling amateur orchestra.  Her strait laced lawyer suitor was in the orchestra.  At night she kept company with him.  Her life had taken on a routine and heavy with the responsibilities of her family.The family's life changed when the Brooklyn Bridegrooms came to town to play the Cleveland Spiders.  A stray ball hit a spectator in the head knocking him unconscious.  Since Doc was the local doctor, the unconscious man was brought to the Allenhouse house for treatment.Vada's heart is torn between her steady but passionless suitor and a \"man of the world\" ballplayer.  We are taken on the ride of confusion and self-imposed guilt Vada struggled with.  Her three sisters are also thrown into emotional whirlwinds as they also struggle with the attention given to them by the visiting ballplayers.This is only one conflict that these sisters must struggle with.  Ms. Pittman deftly and effectively explores the complex inner workings of both familial relationships and the emotions that can come to the surface for young women just embarking on their life's journey.I enjoyed reading this book and will read other books by Allison Pittman.

I immediately noticed that the QC3 provided more noise cancellation than the QC2.  I purchased the QC3 based on this functional aspect.  Music reproduction and comfort were secondary considerations, but at the time both seems very satisfactory.After using the QC3 on a recent 5 hour flight to the West Coast, I am still satisfied with the comfort and music reproduction aspects of the headphones.  Although I am not a audiophile, I would agree that the comments others have made about the QC3 musical reproduction qualities seem to be true.  I think there were probably design trade-offs that the Bose engineers made in order to achieve the excellent over-the-ear noise cancellation levels in the QC3.For me, the on-ear headphone comfort seemed to have a limit of about 6 to 7 hours (I had a two segment return flight of about 8 hours).  However, the QC3 is a very comfortable headphone; they sit rather loosely and exert very light pressure on the ears.  In certain situations, care should be taken to prevent them from falling off; bending over quickly to pick something up may cause them to slide off the ears slightly.What I think is the ultimate value of this product is how relaxed and rested I felt after the 5 hour flight between Hawaii and Los Angeles.  These headphones are simply amazing and an indispensible accessory for the business traveler.The 'noise cancellation' seems to be selective; although all environmental noise is muted, background 'industrial' noise seems to be the primary target of the noise cancellation electronics.I am very happy with my purchase and thank my co-worker for the information he provided about his three noise cancellation headphone purchases before getting his Bose QC2 headphones.

It literally takes two minutes to inflate. You will see some bubbling in the seams. I doesn't seem to affect the way the slide performs. It dries out very quickly in the sun. It's a little awkward to pack up due to it's size, similar to most toys like this. Nothing abnormal though.My 7 year old (54 lbs) has hours of fun on his slide. We normally have any where from 2-8 kids in the play area at once. Never a problem, everyone always has tons of fun with something to do.I would give it 5 stars but my only issue is the overhead sprinkler (no matter how much adjusting) doesn't spray directly into the pool area.

The book does have a French orientation with respect to Gestapo activities in occupied France and does gloss over the activities in the East where the extermination camps and Einsatzgruppen activities took place.  Still, it is a useful edition and offers insights into the flawed characters that composed the Nazi milieu and became the instrument of repression throughout occupied Europe.  Himmler, Heydrich, Kaltenbrunner; all deviant individuals with deep flaws; but no less important are the individuals who reported to them, exhibited unquestioning obedience, and carried out their orders: Schellenberg, Muller, Knochen, Eichmann, Ohlendorf, Hoess, and so on.  Since that time other, larger, better, more comprehensive and balanced texts have emerged on the subject but this book is still worth a read for the insights it offers into the personalities of the Third Reich.  The depiction of Kaltenbrunner, a lawyer who was a seven-foot tall brute, with dueling scars on his face and an ogre-like appearance, and his drinking (a bottle of cognac a day) and smoking (80 to 100 cigarettes a day) is particularly illuminating (and frightening); even Himmler feared him.  So, too, are the tensions that played out between Heydrich, who appears to have been the anointed one, prior to his assassination, and Himmler in the first half of 1942.  Himmler's accumulation of power after Heydrich's death is also covered.  The collapse of the Third Reich and the cowardice displayed by these men in the face of an Allied occupation is chronicled as well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Must be understood in the context of the time it was written...", "unixReviewTime": 1271980800, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2010"}

The bits which at first seem like padding become the most interesting bits eventually.This is a good place to start partly because of Michael Tanner's excellent introduction and also because it is not too long but covers the most important bits of his writing, his attack on Christianity (and the post-Christian mealymouthed morality we've inherited), the moral system which really made him puke.  As Tanner says though, in many of his arguments against Christianity you can see he is arguing against it when practised by the overwhelming majority of people, not the person of Jesus or the philosophy itself which he often seems to appreciate and value.Nietzsche is THE must read for all adults because I could have lived 1000 years and not figured so much of it out myself - that Christianity is a religion of hate, dressed up in 'love'.

Just don't expect one of Doyle's gently humorous looks at the lives of working-class Irish people, like his Barrytown trilogy.This novel deals with the eventful first twenty years of the life of Henry Smart, the son of Henry Smart Senior. Senior is a whorehouse bouncer in early 1900's Dublin, and becomes a part-time murderer for the mysterious Alfie Gandon, whom he never meets. He eventually abandons his family, and their slide into desperate poverty and the decline of his wife is described in haunting detail. Henry Junior leaves home to fend for himself, assisted by his little brother Victor, who dies from consumption.Henry Junior then becomes involved with the Republican Movement, not because he is a staunch Republican, but because he is hoping for a better, more socially just, Ireland. He becomes a crack Republican assassin in an increasingly dirty war, and eventually realises that he is serving a new, shadowy elite, one of whom is the same Alfie Gandon his father used to serve.In the process Doyle makes a number of telling points about \"liberation\" movements, points not only applicable to the Irish experience. Three of the most important are:1. Such movements are often mythologised/idealized, with the myth serving to hide skeletons in the cupboard.2. The leaders of a liberation movement easily form a new elite, intent on amassing wealth and not serving the common people.3. The footsoldiers in a liberation struggle are dispensable, and often do not gain from the struggle.But this is not a pedantic novel, and can be read for enjoyment as well. I would rate it as one of Doyle's best two novels to date, on a par with the excellent \"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\".My only gripe with the novel is that Henry is just too perfect a specimen of manhood given that he grows up on the streets of Dublin.

For the tall, breathtakingly handsome officer would not be easy to elude...and after looking into his piercing blue eyes and feeling the heat of his lean, hard embrace, Maggie wasn't sure escape was what she wanted.  He said he'd free her for the price of a kiss, but somehow Maggie knew that once his lips met hers, she'd belong to him forever!ENTICING ENEMYGrayson Thayer was tired of living a lie.  Seven years was long enough to gather information for the rebels while pretending to be a loyal officer in His Majesty's army.  If only he could tell Maggie the truth...not that she'd care.  The little mercenary would sell her wares to either side for a profit.  Not the sort of woman a man could trust, but trust had little to do with pleasure.

Burlay the other day and was fascinated by his creative approach to weight management.Dr. Burlay, who lost 50 pounds on his weight loss plan and has kept it off, said some diet programs fail for certain people because they unnecessarily eliminate certain foods that your body was \"designed to eat.\" Some may say that's what happens on a low-carb diet, but Dr. Burlay is actually referring to the foods that our ancestors long ago had to survive on -- vegetation, fruits, nuts and what could be \"captured or found.\" The other foods that we consume these days were never meant to enter our bodies.The Foundation Diet explains this in great detail and provides the reader with compelling reasons to get back to the low-carb roots of the early humans.Interestingly, Dr. Burlay explained that our tastes can and will change over time. In other words, foods that we used to find extremely desirable suddenly become less desirable to us after the \"initial discomfort\" of denying ourselves the pleasure of indulging in such foods.\"It is as though your taste buds evolve to a new plateau of satisfaction,\" Dr. Burlay stated. \"Those foods that previously had such a grip over your decision making may actually cause an adverse response. You will go by the donut or pizza shop with a new found freedom and not give in to the primitive part of your brain linked to emotions and food aroma.\"As a 180+ pound weight loss success, I have found this exact phenomena to be right on the money. I never would have thought it would be true, but you can actually lose your desire for your favorite foods. Think about that food you think you could never live without. Got it? Okay, now just imagine there being a day when you become so repulsed by even the thought of that food that you could never put it to your lips again. THAT HAPPENED TO ME!I started my low-carb lifestyle and stopped eating one specific food item that I ate gobs and gobs of without any hesitation. This food was, needless to say, my most favorite food in the world prior to the time I started livin' la vida low-carb (you'll have to read my \"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb\" book to find out what it is!).But, it didn't jive with my low-carb eating plan, so it had to go. It was hard for a few months, but then something amazing happened. POOF! My desire disappeared. Into THIN AIR! Gone forever! Hey, how'd that happen?! I don't know, but it did and I am better off because of it. It really is a miracle and Dr. Burlay recognizes that in his book.\"Once you are eating a diet which is evolutionarily correct, you can and should pay attention to your body's signals to eat, says Dr. Burlay. \"At that point your body will be telling you what it needs and you will find that your 'needs' and 'wants' are the same thing.\"The Foundation Diet is a great book for low-carbers who want to read about little more of the historical precedence that low-carb had on humans long before anybody ever heard of Dr. Robert C. Atkins!In doing some research on Dr. Burlay's views, I couldn't help but be attracted to an article he wrote called \"'Low Fat' is Killing America.\" Oh, I'm lovin' this guy even more already!He notes in that article that the USDA-recommended Food Pyramid \"has not been effective as demonstrated by the increases in rates of overweight and obese Americans\" and that a low-fat diet is not a \"natural\" thing for the body to endure.Here's what Dr. Burlay writes about eating too many carbohydrates (you're gonna LOVE it!):\"After eating a meal rich in carbohydrates, your body secretes hormones that cause storage of the extra blood glucose in the liver as a storage material called glycogen. When this reserve gets filled up, the rest starts getting stored as fat. By changing your approach to eating, this process can reverse and cause fat burning.\"In other words, by eating less fat you make it more likely for your body to store fat. But when you eat more fat, your body becomes a \"fat burning\" machine! That's the science behind livin' la vida low-carb and what helped this former 410-pounder go from flabby fat to sensationally skinny in one year.One criticism of The Foundation Diet, though. That has got to be the UGLIEST book cover in the history of publishing. While I understand the motif that is trying to be presented, the cover design does nothing to attract attention to the reader. And that is such a shame considering the excellent content therein.Nevertheless, The Foundation Diet is worth picking up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "'Foundation Diet' Beckons Humans To Get Back To Their Low-Carb Roots", "unixReviewTime": 1130976000, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2005"}

Although mine was not as bad as Marnie's, I think that I can see where she is coming from.I must say that I was easily hooked by this book. I actually tried a Sample first before committing to reading it. But after the first few chapters, I just couldn't stop. Was this book perfect? No, not at all. But it has its own charm that propels me forward to keep on reading. As Marnie slowly reveals her secrets, I just kept wanting to read until the end.&lt;blockquote>&#34;He was her coming-of-age story.&#34;&lt;/blockquote>I love this particular quote from the book. It's a really good explanation as to who Joe was in Marnie's life. My best friend once told me that you couldn't forget your first love, and that was what happened to Marnie. Although she had an even more difficult time of letting go than most of us, and with reason I think.The story is told through different timelines, narrating Marnie's time with Joe at the age of 19 and Marnie's time as an adult at around 34 years old. I think I wouldn't have liked the book so much if the story wasn't told this way as I wasn't particularly fond of the New Adult part of the story. Joe and Marnie's relationship was mostly physical if you know what I mean. And Marnie was such a reckless and sometimes immature young adult. I really liked the contrast and the comparison between the Marnie then and the Marnie now.At the age of 34, Marnie is married and has two boys. But she has been hanging on to her past and she has been filled with questions about what happened and what could have happened. Her story shows how our mistakes could come to haunt us for years if we keep on holding to them. Marnie is just so deeply damaged and depressed that she was a little bit frustrating, but some of the things that happened to her were heartbreaking. And she's stuck up on getting in touch with Joe again to get some answers. I was mostly fearful for what their encounter would be like.Because of this book, I now want to marry a pilot because I'm so jealous that Marnie got to go wherever she wanted easily. :P Although I probably wouldn't like the absent husband. It certainly made Marnie's relationship with Stuart even more complicated. I wish the book had shown more about them. I loved their two children. They were just so adorable and they had that candid child innocence. I actually liked Marnie's family, and I was kind of sad that she felt detached from them.**************************************************OVERALL, A Little Bit of Everything lost is a story of deeply damaged and flawed people that reflects of first loves, mistakes, and tragedy. But it wasn't overly dramatic, and it even managed to conjure a few laughs from me. It was also thought-provoking and hopeful. There are parts that do not really agree with me, but I still liked the novel all in all. If you've ever been in a crazy whirlwind of a young love relationship, then you might be able to relate to this one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great read", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}

I was tired of barely hearing my earbuds while on planes, so I decided to finally make the purchase which I had been contemplating for months. When my QC3s arrived from Bose, I was anxious to try them out. I had used them previously a few times (albeit briefly) at my local Apple store, so I already knew they sounded great, but when I popped the battery in, flicked the switch, and selected a song on my iPhone, I was amazed at the sound these things could produce. The QC3s deliver AWESOME bass and everything is crystal clear. As for noise cancellation, I did not get to experience its true greatness until I left on my flight. I was shocked at how much of the engine noise was eliminated; at the flick of a switch, 90% of it was gone. I was finally able to listen to my music in its full glory for the first time in the sky. I will never fly without these headphones again. The difference is like night and day, they're worth every penny.Just a note, if you plan on using these with Apple's iPhone, you'll need to buy Bose's \"mobile communications kit\" in order to get a cord that has a headphone connector of the right size. It's $39, but it also comes with adapters for Blackberries and other phones, and lets you talk through the microphone integrated into the cord (at least on the iPhone, not sure about other phones).$349 might sound like a lot for a pair of headphones, but when you experience for yourself the sound quality and effectiveness of the noise cancellation, it's a small price to pay for your own acoustic oasis.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Sound & Noise Cancellation", "unixReviewTime": 1207699200, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2008"}

The Greenbrier bunker, completed in 1959 beneath the tony West Virginia resort, and viewed in detail, was created for the safety of members of the United States Senate, and a discussion is made of that moral dilemma pertinent to the incineration of spouses and children while officeholders are shielded, a trumpeted example of our government's flawed historic attitude towards its citizenry during possible calamities as those mentioned. A theorem submitted throughout by government spokesmen states that there is no defense in place against nuclear attack, which is not quite the case, and no discourse is made of the Star Wars program, albeit the film's format returns often to the known success of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), a distinction of the long Cold War stalemate. The functions of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) are examined, and we are treated to interlarded brief fictional scena of individuals' final moments during an atomic assault featuring well-known film actors (Molly Ringwald, Elliott Gould, et alia) with sputtery images of generally accepted world political villains included for good measure, all of this being completed prior to the Twin Towers tragedy, a final impression being one of nurtured paranoia stemming from an uncaring and probably helpless officialdom.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dripping With Mixed Messages.", "unixReviewTime": 1146182400, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2006"}

{"reviewerID": "A1JFJ9ZULCSG7H", "asin": "0873646193", "reviewerName": "Nevada Storm \"Nevada Storm\"", "helpful": [42, 44], "reviewText": "An interesting read. It is the memoir of a man of action from a time when we, as a nation and as individuals, were more certain of our character and the rightness of our cause.For all of the author's complaining about editors, this book surely could have used one, or at the very least, a competent proofreader. The fact that Paladin Press published the book is an indicator of its less than professional literary quality as well as its rejection by mainstream publishers.The prose is often Victorian and the vagaries of age and memory are obvious at times. There is some redundancy in the book and it has been accused of being self-serving. The accusations of the book as self-serving should be taken cautiously. The book is admittedly the author's recollections and contain his viewpoints on race, bureaucracy, hunting, guns, and people. His style is not in vogue with the current obsession with victim and oppression memoirs. Men like Charles Askins scare the panties off of the effeminate, effete intellectuals of the publishing world.The amount of detailed information regarding caliber, rounds fired, names and relationships is astounding. Keep in mind that this memoir was written when Charley was in his seventies.Charles Askins was the product of the early years of the twentieth century and the place in which he was raised. The standards by which men were measured in those times were quite different from the feminized version of masculinity now upon us. Charles Askins, in many ways, was representative of the western male from that bygone time.Charley's father was an extraordinary man and seems to have failed in some ways to pass along some of his qualities to Charley. The relationship between father and son was one of friendship rather than parental. Charley suffered for it. He was egotistical, incapable of accepting criticism from anyone other than himself, and lacked discipline in some ways.For all of the bravado in his book, especially about his military career, he was not a ground soldier. He was a staff weenie and seemed to exhibit an extraordinary disregard for military discipline. His observation that paratroopers were a cut above regular army troops was an accurate observation, but he himself was not a leader of elite combat troops.His obvious racism towards blacks, Mexicans, Indians, Arabs and the Vietnamese is a product of experience with these groups but he had high praise for the Montagnards and the Nungs in Viet Nam His opinions of Muslims today would be interesting to hear.He often presented conflicting views. He could not abide suffering in animals, and yet he was obsessed with killing them, often simply as a means of testing the effectiveness of a particular caliber. I found his allowing wounded animals to escape to be particularly offensive. His casual, and seemingly admiring recounting of the accomplishments of several African professional game hunters that had individually killed over one thousand rhinos and other animals was a disappointment.With the exception of George Parker, he seemed to place his loyalty on money rather than on persons or employers. He was self-centered and he did not tolerate fools or laggards. He was frustrated with the incompetent morons that seem to make up a disproportionate amount of the bureaucrats running business, politics and the military. It is interesting to read that the same sort of idiots making laws and running things then were as corrupt and incompetent as they are now. In today's age of blame, victimization and moral relativism, he was a man of conviction.I appreciated his willingness to admit to poor performance in the field or in making poor shots. He was devoted to guns, dogs, horses and hunting. He was a tough hombre in the field and probably would have been a buffalo hunter in an earlier time.Charles Askins was not afraid of controversy, and he stood up for his beliefs. He was not the sort of man everyone would like, but was certainly worthy of respect. Our culture would be a bit rougher if we had more like him, and we would be stronger and certainly our moral compass would be more stable.I would have enjoyed sitting and talking with Charles Askins. When crisis situations arise and the enemy is at the gate, I would rather have Charles Askins at my side than the hand wringing social do-gooders that so despise all men of action, but who also depend upon them to guard the night.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Man of Action", "unixReviewTime": 1153526400, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2006"}

The author teaches you how to wean your family off of processed foods and eliminate artificial sweeteners.  She shows us how to incorporate real foods and whole grains into even the busiest of lifestyles.  She encourages people to avoid factory farmed meats and toxin laden dairy products.  Beyond food, she also discusses healing your family with natural remedies and avoiding toxic chemicals in your beauty routine.There are numerous case studies scattered throughout the book and while many of them might be a bit extreme there ARE people who have children that only eat pop-tarts and chocolate milk.  That idea is frightening and the author is quick to point out that YOU (the adult!) are the one responsible for bringing food into your home.  She encourages parents to make smarter choices when it comes to shopping and change gradually so as to not shock your children completely.I thought the discussion of food addiction was particularly interesting.  Apparently, junk food can be addictive and scientists have actually proven that with animal models!The author encourages people to analyze their diets and figure out which areas need to be changed. She says all you need is L.O.V.E.  (Local , Organic, Vegetable-centric, vegetarian, or vegan (your choice), and  Environmentally conscious)  I think that is a great summary of what our diets should be made of!  And she provides common sense, practical ways to achieve a more natural diet. There are m any tips, tricks and recipe ideas to help transition your kids from fast food to real food.  She tells you what to avoid if you are buying premade products (transfats, artificial flavors, and many others) and then gives you healthy snack suggestions like whole grain cookies and flavored rice cakes.The Organic Nanny is a wonderful resource for anyone who is concerned about the foods their child is eating.

The fight scenes were done very well, especially the fight in the subway. All though there were a couple of fights that seemed to be hidden from full view.

I do have to give Jon Foo credit, he has the necessary skills to perform every move and stunt so easily.The acting department on this film was a bit below average and the only thing he is in need of mastering.

You probably rarely give a thought to how small moments sometimes are pivotal in your life and even the moments that seemed your most confused, awkward or sad may become a catalyst for something greater when looked at from a different perspective and in a different time.The book is comprised of short chapters, each is a moment in time in Mr. Augustine's life and how it was pivitol to him.  His book is not preachy, religious or \"new age'y'\"  He is funny, and does not come off as someone who has all the answers....he is someone who is just like the rest of us...he has heartbreaking moments, he does things that are sometimes not wise, he is unsure of his path and often doesn't understand the signs right away that might help him.I found his stories engaging.  They touched me.  Some where sad, some uplifting and all of them made me \"feel\" and be happy to be alive and able to make decisions to make my life and my moments count.Though it is hard, we all need to remember no one is promised a future-but we all have \"now\" and we need to make it the best \"now\" it can be.This is a book that I will definitely recommend to my friends/family to help us all get a little perspective and have a little more appreciation of the special moments in our life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Learning to savor the moment.....", "unixReviewTime": 1270339200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2010"}

I called Fruit of the Loom, and was told that these Easy Care were made of a different material from other Fruit of the Loom underwear and that's why they fit tight, and that they have discontinued the line, so they can't replace them with the correct size.  However I saw on their website they still had them listed with a chart saying old sizing and new sizing and the 34-36 waist is now Large.  I'm guessing they got a lot of complaints.

As a middle-aged Army veteran with PTSD, I have struggled with depression most of my adult life.Medications have been helpful to me in the past during a crisis and I believe there is a place for meds, but they come with profound side effects. This is why I am always searching for non-pharmaceutical methods of beating depression and &#8216;How to Overcome Depression and Anxiety&#8217; is rich with tips, methods and tricks for beating depression without a prescription.However, if you have thoughts of self-harm or of harming others, you need immediate professional help and may require medication. &#8216;How to Overcome Depression and Anxiety&#8217; is best suited for the majority of us who struggle day to day with feelings of sadness and a loss of joy.Really, beating mild or moderate depression comes down to healthy mental hygiene, our habits of thought and how well we take care of ourselves. This brief book, beautiful in its simplicity, tells you exactly how to do this.You&#8217;ll learn the fundamentals of proper mental hygiene, including how to take extraordinary good care of yourself, what triggers your depressive episodes, which foods defeat depression, the importance of proper sleep, the power of physical activity, and the miracle of meditation.Because it is sometimes challenging to know what to do when we are depressed, I keep an emergency depression kit nearby. It includes some of my favorite things like dark chocolate, a reminder to love myself, to go for a walk, to get some sunshine and to relax. And now, it also contains a copy of &#8216;How to Overcome Depression and Anxiety.&#8217;If you are battling depression or concerned about someone who might be depressed, this book is essential.

Pittman inserts a healthy whip-creamed dollop of nostalgia but also a sense of longing and wistfulness for an innocent time out of reach.Vada and her four sisters are startlingly different in personality and thus warrant startlingly different beaux.  Not unlike \"Little Women\", the sisters are believably rendered on page and their triumphs and travails were heartwarming!  The book spans little more than a week in the life of four girls abandoned by their mother at a young age.  The mystery of their mother's disappearance and the spiriting in of The Bridegrooms: a raucous and rowdy baseball team are at the core o this fun and fast read.While so many authors would have planted romance blossoming from the heroine encountering an out-of-towner,  Pittman chooses instead to study our concept of romance and our romantic ideals: how much can be found in the whirlwind of a traveling sportsman, how much romance exists in the steadfast and stalwart, if somewhat consistent suitor from your hometown.Garrison, Vada's patient and virtuous fianc&eacute; is absolutely one of the most winning ( if quiet and steady) heroes in Christian fiction this year.This was equally as compelling as Stealing Home.

Vada, the oldest, longs to play the violin on stage. Her longtime boyfriend, the attorney, does. What he doesn't do, though, is propose. When a baseball player from the visiting team, the Bridegrooms, hits someone in the stands with a ball, it brings the victim and members of both teams to Vada's house where her father, the doctor, can care for the victim privately. An ambitious reporter is also drawn to the scene, and Vada finds herself with two suitors too many and wondering if Garrison's proposal is worth waiting for.Of course, Vada's story is only one of four as each of the sisters finds her own place in the world and home for her heart. Hazel fears she's too unattractive to be loved. Althea, mute by choice since her mother's abandonment of the family, fears risking rejection again. Lisette, the self-absorbed flirt, surrounds herself with suitors at all times.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It's strong on character development and historical interest. The storyline took a while to find and I sometimes wondered about the relevance of some elements, yet the author wraps it all up neatly in the end.

Years passed and I found it again but it was quite expensive (over $25 a bottle).  So I tried this version.  I can definitely notice a difference!  But I believe it's every bit as good as the Lipoflavonoid.  I know the main ingredients are the same.  It contains normal vitamins along with choline, bioflavonoids, and inositol to promote blood flow to the nerves in the ears.  Other ingredients are cellulose (plant origin), crocarmollose, silica, cellulose coating, hydoxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide color, vegetable stearic acid, vegatable magnesium stearate, vanillin, and mannitol.

Hill", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I thought this show was good all the way through to its last season, but I don't know if it ever got quite as good as the beginning.  David Caruso might have seen himself as the lead, and he was good, but Dennis Franz stole the show right from the start.  His performances in the first few episodes are nothing short of top-notch, world-class displays of acting talent.  He exhibits every emotion known to man as he struggles with his vices, loses his job, gets shot several times, and attempts to recover both personally and professionally.  Franz lets the audience know from Episode 1 that he's out to create a truly memorable character, and he succeeded fantastically.Caruso is certainly a highlight, playing the dark, quiet, tough cop, a foil to Franz's loudmouth Andy Sipowicz.  The two had great chemistry, and it's a shame they didn't get a chance to do more seasons together.  Other important characters introduced in Season 1 are Greg Medavoy, James Martinez, Donna Abondando, and Arthur Fancy, all of whom remained for multiple seasons.  Fringe characters include Mike Roberts, who returned from time to time in subsequent seasons; John Kelly's wife Laura, who left before the end of the season, and his obsession, Janice Lecalsi, who appeared in a few episodes with him at the beginning of Season 2; Adrian Lesniak, who eventually developed a short-lived romance with Martinez; and Vince Gotelli, a gruff, older night duty detective who's good for some comic relief.To say that this first season was action-packed would be an understatement.  The show's intense violence, language, and sexuality pushed the boundaries of network TV, delivering graphic content nearly comparable to that of HBO.  But it wasn't just because sex and violence sell; the show portrayed a gritty realism that would've been compromised and watered down by a more conservative approach.  It's a travesty that only the first four seasons have been released on DVD, as the series ran for twelve.  Hopefully, fans of NYPD Blue will someday get their wish and see the show's remaining eight years made available.  In the meantime, Season 1 is a wonderful set to own.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of TV's Best Shows Starts Out Big", "unixReviewTime": 1339632000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2012"}

This is the book that will explain everything a kid needs to know from arrival time all the way to saying goodbye at the end of the visit. It might not be a bad read for grandparents as well.When Grandpa arrives, it is of the utmost importance to hide as quietly as possible, leaping out and giggling only when he has given up that you are home. Offer him an array of snacks, including anything dipped in ketchup. Definitely go outside to show him around the neighborhood, making sure to show him all the best puddles. Back inside, pretending is very important: build a pirate cave, leap from chair to chair over shark infested waters, or create a two man band.Soon it is naptime. This means Grandpa will take a much needed snooze and you may use that time to do whatever you like. Throw together a hasty clean up right before your parents get home and then snuggle up together in the big chair. Goodbye is the hardest part of the day, but it is made a bit easier knowing that Grandpa will be back - he needs a lot of babysitting.Really cute idea for a book, with completely adorable illustrations. I like how the grandpa is a bit stooped over, with a comb-over and a reddened nose. He's good natured too, going along with all of his grandson's nutty ideas.

Probably not...even if you are black yourself.  In our society the presumption is that people are white unless they are specifically raced otherwise.  This presumption of whiteness as \"the norm\" and everyone else as  \"the other\"  - and the immense societal costs of this presumption - is at the heart of this collection, explored in 16 accessible readings designed to allow educators at different levels to initiate conversations about whiteness and white privilege in courses in many disciplines.  It's divided into four sections, each with discussion questions:The Power of Invisibility exposes the hidden power of whiteness, and the advantages it provides to whites as a group without them ever having realize, much less acknowledge, that such advantages exist.The Power of the Past traces how and why the definition of \"whiteness\" has evolved and changed over the years.  For example, there was a time when the Irish, Jews and Eastern Europeans (among others) were not considered white.  \"The Possessive Investment in Whiteness\" demonstrates that long after slavery ended, public policy (even that supposedly designed to help minorities, like Urban Renewal) has systematically and adversely effected African Americans' ability to amass net worth, enhancing the rewards of past discrimination. Meanwhile, when white people start to feel disadvantaged or inconvenienced, they blame \"affirmative action.\"  For example, in the Bakke case, where the plaintiff argued that medical school affirmative action programs disadvantaged white applicants like himself, neither Bakke nor the Court contested the legitimacy of medical school admissions standards that reserved five seats in each class for children of wealthy donors. Most universities give similar preference to the children of alumni, which again, compounds past discrimination.The Power of Privilege examines and enumerates the kinds of benefits - large and small - that white people take for granted, perhaps because they never even have to think about them. For example, as Peggy MacIntosh writes,  \"I can go shopping pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed; I can swear, or dress in secondhand clothes, or not answer letters, without having people attribute these choice to the bad morals, the poverty, or the illiteracy of my race; I can be pretty sure that if I ask to talk to the \"person in charge,\" I will be facing a person of my race.\"The Power of Resistance attempts to answer the question: How can white people who do not wish to participate in the system find ways to use that privilege to combat racism and the system of privilege as a whole?Unfortunately, many discussions of whiteness end with \"but I never owned slaves.\" This  accessible collection will go a long way towards trying to pry open such minds.

He first rose to prominence in the early 1970s when he chose neither serialist complexity nor minimalist crawling, writing instead almost bar by bar in a furious expressionist style. His Darmstadt credo, \"Music must be full of emotion and the emotions full of complexity\" inspires him to this day. Hanssler Classic is to be commended on having launched the Rihm Edition, which will make many of Rihm's greatest compositions available on disc over the next several years. This first volume contains four concertante works performed by the SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg with a changing cast of conductors and soloists.The most striking part of \"Music fur Oboe und Orchester\" (1995/2002) is something that came only with the recent edition, a nearly three-minute oboe solo (Rihm is very fond of going back and writing new lines over existing works). The orchestra then enters, and the mood drastically changes. The scoring is very light, with the oboe maintaining long lines with a succession of individual orchestral instruments playing pointillistically. I've never heard a concerto quite like this. The soloist and orchestra might initially be seen as anatagonists as is common with 20th century concertos, though instead of a confrontation they seem to uneasily go along aside one another. But then we get an uproariously bouncy ending, with the oboe joining the orchestra in a dance. \"Styx und Lethe\" for cello and orchestra (1997/98) reminds me a lot of Berio's \"Chemins II\" for viola and chamber orchestra in for most of the work the soloist furiously saws away at a succession of basic lines while the ensemble is like a halo of development around him. The scoring is intriguing, with the opening section bass-heavy before higher pitches enter in a cathartic movement. I especially love how the music builds up into a grand ostinato involving seemingly every member of the orchestra.For the most part, \"Dritte Musik\" for violin and orchestra (1993) has the violinist dueling with percussion, mainly on congas, bongos and marimba. The orchestra throws in little blasts on brass from time to time or keeps up some smooth lines on low strings, but generally stays out of the fight. Some of the rhythms here are catchy, resembling the pre-Columbian beats of his opera THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO. \"Erster Doppelgesang\" for viola, cello and orchestra (1980) is the oldest work here. Probably the major stylistic matter one notices in this piece that is missing from Rihm's later work are allusions to the Romantic tradition like flotsam and jetsam on the neo-expressionist tide. Out of the concertos on this disc, I find this piece features the coolest-sounding extended techniques on its two solo instruments. The work ends with solo snare drum rolls, giving a rather creepy martial feeling.I look now at what I've written and see that, except for making comparisons to other works, I managed to tell very little of what the music really sounds like. Indeed, Rihm himself is known as a critic of programme notes, with the booklet for this CD even including some of his correspondence on the matter with a festival director. Nonetheless, if you are interested in contemporary repertoire that directs strong modernist gestures towards constant activity and a rich language, just take my word for it that Rihm's work is always worth looking into, and this disc gives a convenient overview.(FWIW, my favourite Rihm pieces are JAGDEN UND FORMEN, available on a sexily packagedDG disc, and the String Quartet No 3., performed by the Ardittis and issued first on Montaigne and then Naive.

For instance, if you want to learn about the IRA pick up  'The IRA: A History' by Tim Pat Coogan.  And if you're interested in a fact  packed story of the Easter 1916 Rising, 'Rebels' by Peter DeRosa is  incredibly accurate and beautifully written.

Welch \"brazil88\"", "helpful": [1, 6], "reviewText": "Read the reviews on Amazon and C/Net and thought I would give the QC3's a try even though there were comments about the loss of highs and lows on noise reduction headphones.  Tried them anyway, and they did a great job of eliminating white noise, but they didn't sound any better than a set of good quality in-ear headphones.  Guess for $350 I expect noise reduction AND excellent sound.Anyway, I am returning them, and here is my main beef.  When you want to return something to a quality retailer, like Amazon or Zappos or..., they send you an email with a return authorization, and a mailing label with the postage paid.  They may or may not deduct the cost of the return postage from your return credit, but you know that up front.  The issue is the convenience.  All you do with Amazon is slap the return label on the box and set it outside your door or drop it at Mail Box, etc.With Bose, when you call in for a return, the moment the agent figures out they cannot talk you into keeping the headphones, they quickly end the conversation saying you will receive an email explaining the return process.That is, they send you an return authorization number and a return address in the body of the email.  That's it.My job now, is to get find a box because they send the headphones to you in a flimsy plastic envelope.  When the headphones arrived the headphone box was dented on all 4 corners, and I am sure the box will get banged up some more if I do the same.  Since I am responsible for the return, I need a shipping box.  Then, instead of applying a pre-printed label and sticking the package outside my door, I will be driving to the nearest mail location, standing in line, filling out forms, and overpaying for shipping (that Bose would get a discounted rate for).It is not rocket science to figure this out - esp. when others have done it before you.  I am going to guess that this is a strategy by Bose to make it more difficult to return their products - which makes it more likely the customer keeps the product.Anyway, I have spent over a couple thousand over the years on Bose speaker products.  I realized I was overpaying for a great product that would be backed up by exceptional customer service.

A totally updated work that builds on his earlier book ((The Spirit of Shamanism) this book explores shamanism as we find it in the world, in the psyche, and in neo-shamanic practices.Dr. Walsh has mastered the art of writing in a popular manner rooted in rigorous research. There is no doubt about his sources as he carefully provides them in footnotes for the more curious reader. In his even-handed presentation of multiple perspectives Dr. Walsh models the tolerance for ambiguity he notes as necessary for a mature experience of the mystery of the universe.Most important, with regard to the subjective aspects of shamanic experience, he models \"the principle of causal indifference\" which reflects an acceptance (rare in our society) that \"subjectively identical experiences can be produced by multiple causes\" (p. 196).This is a must read for mental health professionals whose map of the universe includes the potential of non-ordinary states for healing as well as for the layperson trying to dig their way through all the misinformation on shamanism that has piled up in the \"new age\" market over the years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Power of Dwelling in Ambiguity", "unixReviewTime": 1192406400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2007"}

I figured that because it was low in price, it must not be very good.  But this was exactly the style I was looking for, and had all the features I was looking for, and it fit my sink.  So I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.When I opened the box and saw all the various pieces I'd have to assemble, I had a lil bit of an anxiety attack!  &#34;Oh schnitzel,&#34; I thought, &#34;this looks complicated.&#34;  But you know what?  It turnt out to be fairly easy.  The instructions could have been a little better, and because it's manufactured in Israel I think there were some minor translation errors.  But it all went together rather easily.  The only trouble I encountered was when I did a few things incorrectly, not following the instructions.  Once I referred back to the instructions and realized &#34;oh yeah I'm not supposed to tighten down this part yet&#34; and &#34;oh yeah that's right I was supposed to screw these threaded rods in first, wasn't I?&#34;, things went smoothly.As far as form fit and function, this beauty is a treasure.  It's wonderful to look at, and operates smoothly and easily.  And even though it's plastic, it has a good quality feel about it.  In fact the plastic design has its advantages: it will be easy to replace once the time comes.  My old faucet was difficult to remove, for instance, because it was so rusted.  I couldn't get it out without breaking it.  Whereas this all-plastic design is a breeze to screw on and screw off.  In fact I was disappointed installation was so quick and easy because I wanted to play with it some more.  Putting it in was fun!Only thing I'm not sure about is how well it's going to hold up over time.

The efficiency of noise cancellation is high enough to allow acceptable in-airplane use while the audio quality remains almost unaffected. And while the starting point is also quite good - even if IMHO slightly oversaturated (I prefer more neutral/linear characteristics) - this makes the listening experience an enjoyable one. Of course the active cancelling does not hold on a direct comparison to good passive noise isolation (especially on lower frequencies) as found in good ear-plugs e.g. from SHURE but regardless of that I somehow switched and reach for the plugs only when my BOSE run out of energy (very rare - the battery holds a good number of hours) or I simply don't have place or will to carry and track the bigger item. The only negative thing is that it requires substantially higher output power from the driving device - meaning: one has to set the volume about twice as high as with the isolating plugs to achieve similar results.

Nicole McInnes's debut YA novel emotionally addresses the despondency many teens face on a daily basis. Brianna may be a product of poor parenting and disloyal friends, but her dilemma is also the consequence of her own wayward behavior and decisions. Narrated in Brianna's own fantastic, first-person voice, her life could become a sum of bleak outcomes, but instead her story takes turns that guide her down a path of hope. As compassion arrives from the most unexpected of individuals, Brianna shows remarkable resilience in confronting her problems and finding a way to make something positive out of impossible situations. It's refreshing to encounter a YA book that does not sidestep the reality of stark issues, and yet navigates them towards a resolution that is uplifting and responsible. Employing clever plot twists, smooth, energized prose, and the seamless use humor to lighten difficult circumstances, this is a compelling and heartwarming story that invests you in Brianna's plight. I found myself unable to put the book down as I rooted for Brianna to overcome her problems and maintain her dignity. McInnes has created a strong, sensitive, and likeable character in young Brianna. It would be wonderful to see her growth continue in a sequel.

You either own an album or two or have one of the band's &#34;Best Of&#34; albums and are looking to dig a little deeper into their calatogue.  You've undoubtedly heard songs like &#34;Aqualung&#34; or &#34;Locomotive Breath&#34; on the radio and know that, back in the '70s, these guys could rock pretty hard.  Well, it's time to expand your mind a bit.Overall, I give this collection 4 our of 5 stars because it is, as it states, a set.  My rating is based on all 5 albums being part of the set since that's how they're packaged.  I will, however, rate each album individually here.Disc 1 is an absolute no-brainer:  1971's 'Aqualung', the band's best-known and best-selling album of their career.  The majority of the band's songs that get played on the radio are from this album, and this is the album on which most people base their knowledge and understaning of Jethro Tull.  A pretty straightforward rock album, it borders on hard rock territory with the title track and &#34;Locomotive Breath.&#34;  Listen to it once and you'll understand why it's such a popular record.  Unsurprisingly, I give this one 5 stars.Disc 2 is probably my least favorite album out of this set, 1973's 'A Passion Play'.  The follow-up to their famously over-the-top progressive rock concept album 'Thick as a Brick', this album consists of a whopping 2 songs:  Part I and Part II.  However, these two songs together run just a hair over 45 minutes, so you can imagine that a lot of musical ground is explored in these two songs.  And a lot of musical ground is covered; 'A Passion Play' has been described as the most musically-challenging album the band ever recorded.  The only problem with a statement like that is it can be a rather challenging album for fans to listen to.  I'll simply sum it up a being a little bit...weird.  Musically, it is a very good album, but, like 'Thick as a Brick', it's a bit over-the-top in its themes and lyrics.  I give this disc a solid 4 stars.Disc 3 jumps ahead 2 years to '75's 'Minstrel in the Gallery'.  Somewhere between 'Aqualung' and 'A Passion Play' is the music of 'Minstrel in the Gallery'--sometimes gentle yet sometimes heavy.  Unlike the bare-bones version of 'Aqualung', what we get is the 2002 remastered version of 'Minstrel in the Gallery' which offers two bonus tracks:  live versions of the title track and &#34;Cold Wind to Valhalla.&#34;  Musically, this album is far more balanced than 'A Passion Play', and my favorite tracks are &#34;Cold Wind to Valhalla&#34; (both the studio and live tracks), the &#34;Baker St. Muse&#34; medley, &#34;Pan Dance,&#34; and, of course, the title track itself (though only the studio version; the live version cuts out at 2:12).  A solid album, I give it 4 stars, but it's awfully close to 5.Disc 4 is my second-to-least favorite album in the set:  'Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll:  Too Young to Die!'.  Closer to 'Aqualung' than its predecessor, 'Mistrel in the Gallery', it's a good ol' rocker of an album.  My personal favorites are the title track, &#34;Salamander,&#34; and &#34;A Small Cigar.&#34;  Another solid album, I give this one 4 stars as well.Disc 5 could arguably be the best album of this collection--possibly better than 'Aqualung'-- 1977's 'Songs from the Wood'.  More acoustic than the other albums in this set, it marks a change in the band's music, focusing more on their British folk music roots and less on their blues/rock roots.  My favorite tracks off this album are the title track, &#34;Hunting Girl,&#34; &#34;Ring Out, Solstice Bells,&#34; &#34;Velvet Green,&#34; &#34;The Whistler,&#34; and &#34;Fire at Midnight.&#34;  I give this album 5 stars, and it earns each and every one.If you're still interested in digging a little deeper into the music of Jethro Tull--at least the music they recorded and released in the '70s--I highly recommend picking up this album.  While the price tag of $18.99 seems rather steep, keep in mind that you're getting 5 albums' worth of music.  To buy these albums separately, you'd be paying $9.49 for 'Aqualung', $6.99 for 'A Passion Play', $9.49 for 'Minstrel in the Gallery', $9.49 for 'Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll:  Too Young to Die!', and $9.49 for 'Songs from the Wood'.  So, to get the same albums, you could spend $44.95 or $18.99.

A terrific concept is this, the grouping of Malone's fictional observations of a dozen Southern women, as diverse a group as the real tapestry of women in the south.Led by Malone's award-winning \"Stella, Red Clay\" - which is more of a look into the relationship between a father and son, both of whom admire ex-Hollywood star Stella, from a distance, this story was worth the price of the book and definitely deserved the two national awards it garnered.  In the collection, about 7 of the pieces are well-developed, and the rest fall a little short of the artistry you've come to expect from Malone's novels.  My personal favorite was the look into the soul of a battered woman in \"Charmain, White Trash Noir\" - Malone perfectly captures the lack of self-esteem, yet the ladylike manner a real Charmain would display when confronted with the dilemma of airing her marital dirty laundry in order to save herself from a conviction.I granted 4 instead of 5 stars because I particularly disliked the snapshot of Malone's \"Justin-Cuddy\" series...all about a local deb in Hillston (Patty, Love & Other Crimes).  It definitely did not do the series justice.From the creation of the concept, the cleverness of the cover in the oversize paperback, the ebb and flow of Malone's poetry written as prose, you'll enjoy this collection.

I had flashbacks to the maximalism of The Tin Drum by Gunter Grass, which also concerns a violent political standoff in a Post Office. Doyle's style is extremely accessible and vivid and powerful in the way that Hemingway created strength by his use of short, punchy syntax like a newspaper writer. Doyle worked hard in his research for this novel and he succeeded in transporting me back to another era. The dialogue was noteworthy: masterfully terse, dense and authentic. The characters, many of whom are historical figures from Easter 1916, despite their often hideous acts against the state and each other were round and fully drawn in only a few brush strokes: they usually evoked sympathy or compassion. It is a tale about the human spirit striving to free itself from the fetters of poverty and oppression despite the worst possible odds. I admire Doyle as a writer and respect his command of his craft.

Dundee started out writing private eye fiction, and he still does that, but lately he's added another layer of narrative to his acumen:  the Western.  Rio Matanza is his second novel in the Bodie Kendrick Bounty Hunter series, and he offers up action by the bucketful in this tale.The full-length novel opens up with Kendrick joining forces with another bounty hunter named Doc Turpin, a man who's equally as rash and bold as Kendrick is.  Together, they take down the Harrup-Klegg Gang shortly after a holdup in New Gleanus, Arizona.  But that's just the beginning of this novel because Dundee is just getting warmed up.A lot of Western writers would content themselves with the manhunt for the bank robbers, and that would be plenty of action for most readers to settle down with.  However, Dundee features that as an opening bid only and quickly moves a little more deeply into his characters.Not only is Kendrick a manhunter, but he's also a curious man.  When Doc Turpin apparently rides out of town in the middle of the night, that's curious.  Flush with cash, not needing another job immediately, Kendrick start trailing his new partner in criminal apprehension - only the trail leads down to Mexico where a small town is fighting for its life against a corrupt Rurale officer.Dundee peppers this Western tale with plenty of lore and smidgens of history squirreled away here and there.  He's good at tying the characters and the story to the rough-hewn and often lawless land south of the border in the late 19th century.  I felt like I was there on the trail with Kendrick, and there's plenty of fighting and gunplay to keep Western readers happy.The characterization of the secondary players is spot on as well.  Doc Turpin is enjoyable as second fiddle tough guy, and Estraleta is a great little sexy firebrand with surprises of her own, but it's Confederate Colonel Huntsford Bradley that stands out as a truly tortured man in need of a war.Readers of Louis L'Amour, Zane Gray, and William Johnstone will appreciate this read.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Western Action", "unixReviewTime": 1343606400, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2012"}

Britten's deep understanding and sympathy with youth have often been commented as has his 'deep nostalgia for the innoncence of childhood'. This composition, as well as the 'Missa brevis' on this disc reflect this sentiment.  'A Ceremony of Carols' consists of nine carols preceded by a 'Processional'ending with a 'Recessional'.  Of the nine carols, all are of medieval or Renaissance origin.  The performance of this work by Willcock's King's College Choir is totally excellent!  The diction is the best that I have heard, as is the quality of the boy's voices. This assessment includes  the 1990 Cleobury recording where I felt that the quality of the voices was not 'up to par' and the diction somewhat 'muddied'. AND Cleobury's soprano soloist was 'breathy' to the point of being annoying.  I do wonder if he, himself, felt that way after he heard the finished product. He is really quite excellent, and I was surprised by this recording overall.\"Hymn to St. Cecelia\" for unaccompanied chorus.  Since Britten was born on St. Ceclia's Day, many feel that this prompted him to compose something special for it.  It was written in 1942 and is a setting of a poem by W.H.Auden.  The music reflects perfectly the restrained intensity of the words.  Quite an interesting work, and well-performed by Willcocks.\"Rejoice in the Lamb\" op.30 (Festival Cantata).  The Cantata sets excerpts from an extended poem of the same name by the 18th century poet, Christopher Smart.  Britten sets ten short sections, all dedicated to the glory of God in a manner somewhat foreshadowing the vissionary Blake or even Whitman.  The cantata is scored for four soloists, four-part choir, organ and (in this version) percussion.  Here again, Ledger's choir far surpasses Cleobury's 1990 disc.  BUT it does not quite come up to the 1984 rendition by the Corydon Singers with Chance and Bostridge featured soloists.\"Te Deum and Jubilate Deo in C\".  The Te Deum dates from 1935 and was composed for the choir of St.Mark's, London; it is written for treble solo, four-part choir and organ.  the Jubilate, although composed much later, in 1961, is also in C, and forms a convenient companion work. In these two compositions, Britten eschews any banal display of contrapuntal writing, so characteristic a trademark of countless shorter settings of these two works. Ledger's choir performed this just beautifully; I loved it!\"Missa Brevis in D\" op 63 for boys' voices and organ.  The Missa Brevis is a direct descendant of 'A Ceremony....', in that the composer was moved to write it after he heard a performance in 1958 in Westminster Cathedral.  Here again the voices are scored in three parts, but with organ instead of harp.  It was well performed by Willcocks, but I personally do not prefer it.This recording has been reissued and is available at Amazon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a voice teacher and early music fans", "unixReviewTime": 1235692800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2009"}

I read the reviews here before I decided on the SHURE E4C ($299) earphone. It sounds fine with the store demo CD player, but when I tried it on my laptop on the airplane, that earphone really sounded cheap.  When I played the \"Prelude to Act I of Carmen\", the bass was totally cut-off, I decided that is definitely not the one for me.I brought my laptop to the Bose store and have a set of testing music.  I mainly tried the QC2 and QC3.  As many other mentioned, the QC3 has a little stronger bass, and the QC2 has a little clearity (but very hard to tell the difference). But the noise cancelling on the QC3 is a lot better than the QC2, you can very easily tell the difference.  Although, I strongly prefer the QC2's regular battery, but I decided to try the QC3 first.My first in flight try was about 4 hours, long enough to see if the on-ear design cause any problem for me.  I have to say that I don't feel tightness at all. Everything feel good, and the sound quality is better than I expected (because I read a lot nagative feedback here :)The music type I like covers vocal, instrumental, classical, pop/disco, rock&roll.;  The classical music is the most challengign to speakers/earphones.  The QC3 performs well on all account so far.  The bass is just right, I didn't feel it is over amplified as other mentioned.  The high frequency was reproduced acurately, and vocal is very beautiful.There is a free Lexar MP3 player, which is a plus for me since I don't have one. I love the Lexar design, which allows me to add SD card.  I ordered a 2GB Kingston for $26, it will give me enough space to put all the music I need to store. The build, on the other hand, feel quite cheap.I highly recommend this headphone.  Yes the price is high, and I hope it will drop to a more reasonable level.======================================================================I have it for a while now, and took it on two bus trip in Mexico, this thing works even better on bus!  The noise cancelling worked so well, that you hear the noise from your own mouse all the time :)  I have to say I like it more and more.  And luckly, none of the problem people complaint about here happens to me.  The bass is just right for me. I don't get the \"too much\" feeling at all.  If I'd got the QC2, I might complaint about a \"weak bass\" by now.Battery Life:1.  The headset battery runs 20+ hours as advertised. But I do perfer a regular AAA battery, which is cheap and easy to find anywhere in the world.2.  The MP3 player uses AAA battery.  A regular AAA runs 4-5 hours, a rechargable runs 5+ hours.  An interesting thing to use rechargable is that the battery indicator on the player never shows \"Full\", I guess the rechargable has a lower voltage than the regular, but it runs longer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great one for classical and vocal music", "unixReviewTime": 1164240000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2006"}

Something I really did not like about this is that I had to pay the S&H; cost ~$7, I mean is not like I broke them.So I received my new set and works fine, no problems until lately when I noticed the cable started to wear out from the headset end. I tried getting a cable in RadioShack but Bose created its own Stereo connector(three strips), so the Radio Shack 2.5mm stereo (two strips) adapter did not work, lots of noise.Thank God I contacted Bose (even though my warranty had expired) they sent a new cable with no cost for me.Sound:They have excellent sound, good response, bass, and is a clear sound. I'm not an expert or anything but from what I like these are perfect.Special note for Musicians:One thing I did not like about them is that I tried them while playing my drumset, and they failed misserably, they feel the loud noises and buzz all over. So for musicians, keep looking, these are not for you (unless you play classical)Durability:Not good, it looks Bose can improve on this field. You need to really take good care of these in order to get a long life out of them.Noise cancelling:I've flown with these and been in noisy environments, they are good noise-cancelling headsets, though there can be better at a better price noise-cancellation is your need.Battery:So far I've not had problems with the battery, but i've seen the battery and it's costly: $50 for a new one. Though, I haven't done the math on how much would I have spent on disposable batteries.Fit and comfort:These are perfect for me; I've had no issues at all with the fit or comfort, though I noticed the left pad has started to wear out. But that falls on the durability section.Overall:I would say if you have the money go ahead and buy them, besides Bose has an excellent plan to pay over a year, so that's good.

We had \"The Plunge\" slide by Banzai, which lasted about 2 seasons before it lost its structural integrity due to weakening seams all over the slide. We just finished our first weekend with the slide and it was great. Better than \"The Plunge\" in that it holds less water, is much easier to clean, dry and put away, is probably safer b/c it has walls alongside the slide, is lighter & stores smaller. \"The Plunge\" holds so much water in the pool that you end up leaving the slide blown up all day long b/c you don't want to waste/release the volume of water. This slide can be shut off periodically throughout the day when the kids are taking a break. I was concerned that it would be a bit small for our 8 year old, but it's fine-probably OK for a child up to 10/11 years old. Two shortfalls of this slide are that larger kids fly right over the pool wall at the base of the slide b/c the length of the pool there is short. I've also noticed the kids have various rub burns, none too serious, just something we never experienced with \"The Plunge\". I'm happy we bought this slide-lots of fun and hopefully it will last longer than 2 seasons.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1308614400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2011"}

When the stove arrived, I tested it out prior to going camping. It is very easy to set up. Good quality material. The biggest disappointment was the valve that controls the heat.

At that point, I didn't have time to get a new stove for my camping trip. I used the stove to cook just about every meal while camping. The problem with this stove is that the heat is always on high.

There's also quite a wide range of format of poems, some the rhyming kinds we all had to write as kids and even some free form ones. I have to admit that my favorites are the ones that had some form of rhyming in the verses because I love how well they flowed when read out loud. A really fun poem was called \"Emailing Rachel\" about the actress Rachel McAdams. It has a humorous little story to it that is fun to read in poetry form. I can't say I liked them all as I found some a bit frenzied and scattered in thought and verse, making them almost difficult to understand. The positive thing is that those kinds of poems are not the norm in this collection. There were more good ones than ones I didn't take a liking to.

Althea hasn't spoken since their mother's disappearance and pens poetry to express the thoughts of her heart. And the baby, Lisette, is 17 going on 25 and a bit boy-crazy, to put it mildly. Like many sisters, their very different personalities result in frequent spats and arguments, yet they are also fiercely protective of each other. This multi-faceted novel weaves each of their stories into a captivating tale of excitement, romance, and even a bit of intrigue.And yes, there really was a baseball team known as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Delightful book", "unixReviewTime": 1271635200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2010"}

Garr", "helpful": [11, 15], "reviewText": "I'd just like to add my comments on the Bose Quiet Comfort 3 Acoustic Noise Canceling Heaphones.I have a very annoying hearing problem; whereas I get distorted sound in my right ear triggered by sounds either directly entering the ear, or through the middle ear. This occurs when I wear an earplug on the right side, but not the left.These sounds then trigger a high pitched, loud tone that doesn't go away for a few hours afterwards.I tried these Headphones to strictly cut out the noise and eliminate distracting sounds. In a busy house, with dishwashers running, dinner cooking, TVs on and a CD player going in the kitchen, there is plenty of noise to trigger a ringing sound in my ear. They also seem reduce the fan noise of routers, switches and server room products. I wear these at home, in labs at work, in the home and work offices.I am not saying these headphones solve the constant ringing. But they eliminate the triggers effectively and I don't have to deal with the ringing occurring, and re-occurring because most of the noises that trigger it in a are reduced drastically.They also are effective in the subway/train, the Accela, and of course with jet engine noise- real or simulated.These are very good headphones for listening to music, but plenty of folks have already testified to that attribute. I'm saying if you like peace and quiet, but would still like to hear conversations going on in the room, as well as eliminate the 'junk' noise- do not hesitate to buy these headphones.I am very pleased with all the features and benefits, but of course they are expensive. I tried a good friends' pair before making the plunge. They are worth every dime (to me... maybe even to you too!).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hearing Problems?

This may or may not be a concern for you.All in all, it's a neat way to keep a handgun on you.  To really execute it perfectly, they would need to customize the set to both the handgun AND the phone, which would probably bump the pricing up to the point that it wouldnt be reasonable to buy.

The budgetary limitations are obvious, but if you can get over the fact that the monsters don't look anything like shrews, and the silly duck-walking thing, there's a fairly taut little thriller in there. Giant Gila Monster is less effective, with cornball humor, cringeworthy musical numbers, liberal doses of maudlin sentimentality, and a really blah monster dragging down its 'camp' appeal. This movie really needed Eddie Cahn or Herb Strock at the helm. Watchable but probably not quite bent enough for many C-movie enthusiasts.The Diamond DVD is a mixed bag as well. First, I did not experience any of the technical problems that others have reported here; my disc played fine (other than some visible pixelation during the lightning flashes in Shrews) and I had no problem accessing any menu items, etc. Second, while neither source print is spectacular, they are definitely NOT transferred from mediocre VHS tapes as one reviewer stated. Compared to my VHS copy of Killer Shrews, the print used here compares quite favorably. There is some light speckling and scratching, but no major damage or jump-cutting. The tonal values are quite decent, (slightly richer than my VHS) and sharpness and shadow/highlight detail are much improved. For the money spent I'm quite pleased with Killer Shrews. Giant Gila Monster fares not so well. Compared to my VHS copy taped off public TV the DVD source print is sharper but also quite a bit darker, particularly in the night scenes and toward the end of the film in general. The highlight and midtone detail are thus actually improved in many scenes, but the shadow detail fills in a bit in the lighter scenes and a lot in the darker scenes, rendering much of the climax of the movie very murky. The DVD also exhibits more overall wear: light speckling and scratching, distracting reel change 'dots', jump cuts between reels, etc. In other words, even though the DVD is sharper, I'm hanging on to my videotape.For me, Killer Shrews alone is worth the price of this disc (I'm assuming Madacy's version is as horribly butchered as their other Killer Creature Double Features). I wouldn't recommend spending the bucks just to get The Giant Gila Monster unless you have no other copy available.

I need to know the latest in technology for diagnosis and treatment of clotting and bleeding disorders, particularly for cardiopulmonary bypass.  On several occasions I've consulted this book for background information on how to treat a patient, only to find that the information just isn't there, or perhaps the book is only written for post-graduate hematologists, already in practice who already understand everything that is discussed and just need a quick reference.  There are those of us who work in the healthcare arena as a team and are expected to update our skills and share what we've learned with other members of the team.  Just because someone has an MD doesn't mean they know everything that a hematologist would know.  As an example, the condition \"warm-reactive autoimmune hemolytic anemia\" wasn't sufficiently covered as it pertains to cardiopulmonary bypass.  I couldn't find the terms \"warm agglutinin\", \"cold agglutinin\" or even \"agglutinin\" in the index, though perhaps it is there somewhere else.  There wasn't a discussion on Heparin-Protamine titration (HPT) techniques or a comparison of the different technologies for measuring HPTs and activated clotting times (ACTs). There is a section on patients who don't respond to platelet inhibitors due to a genetic defect, but I couldn't find anything on the newest platelet mapping techniques and how to test the effectiveness of platelet inhibitors on patients and what it means for their treatment.  Patients are placed on platelet inhibitors blindly without proper genetic testing or follow-up for efficacy, and a book like this should surely cover this topic as how to test for effectiveness. For someone who is involved in primarily cardiac patients that may or may not have clotting and/or bleeding disorders, I recommend the book \"Principles and Practice of Point-of-Care Testing\" by Gerald J.

History is not dwelled on; today's young leaders probably wouldn't know JP Morgan, Muriel Siebert, or EF Hutton if they tripped over them.  Nor would many even know the names Hornblower, First Harlem, Bache, Hutton, or Shearson.  But, as of this writing, with African Americans leading both Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston, it is nice (and necessary) to read a concise history of African Americans on Wall Street.  Did you know that in the 1960's, Merrill Lynch, with 2500 fixed commission brokers, hired only 3 African American brokers?  If not for this book, how many would know of Thorvald McGregor (MercerHicks) and Lawrence Lewis (Abraham &amp; Co) , the first two African American Registered Reps in 1949?  Or Abraham Cowing (FL Salomon); Howard Law grad Norman McGhee (McGhee and Company, the first black NASD securities firm); Philip Jenkins and Earle Fisher (Baruch Brothers) who started Special Markets;  Lilla St John (Oppenheimer), the first black female broker in 1953; June Middleton (Cohen Simonson); Attorney Wylie H. Whisonant (Bache); Clarence B. Jones (Carter, Berlind, Sanford Weill, &amp; Arthur Levitt); or Joseph L Searles (the first black full member of the NYSE in 1970)?  The author, Gregory Bell, is the son of the Travers Bell, who founded the first black-owned member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, so he had deep access to the inside story of the black history of Wall Street.  Although there were a couple of paragraphs that I might not have agreed with (the speculation that African Americans did not invest in equities in the 1950's because they were more concerned with basic civil rights than investing), the book remains an excellent, informative read.  It is especially interesting when discussing the strategies of the early firms (selling mutual funds that required less financial sophistication); the trials of how companies were founded (For example, Daniels and Bell hatched their business plan after seeing The Wiz on Broadway, spent a year trying to get financing, and finally scored some needed fund after Myron Kandell wrote a story on their efforts and Nixon's SEC Chief William Casey pushed through an exemption to some rules for them and influenced his friends to invest in the firm), as well as when discussing the effect of Municipal policies to require that a percentage of their Public Finance business be done with minority owned vendors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An important brief history", "unixReviewTime": 1016236800, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2002"}

Torn between two choices in life &#8211; keeping her family intact and working toward restoring the love she once shared with her husband or walking away with her children and seeking a fresh start and clean slate.Nina Powers is unlike any female lead I&#8217;ve read before. Part of her is strong and unstoppable. She puts the well being of her special needs daughter, Kylie, first above her own needs. It&#8217;s heart warming to read such devotion. Her husband has developed an addiction to prescription medication, and he is constantly lashing out at her, creating an unsafe environment for their children. Despite the constant tantrums and verbal attacks by Shane, Nina remains unaffected on the outside. She doesn&#8217;t play the victim card &#8211; in fact she loathes the word &#8211; and she doesn&#8217;t let herself drown in her sorrow over her dire situation (failing marriage, limited financial resources). Instead she searches for solutions to her problems and takes action. As Shane&#8217;s moods wax and wane, it&#8217;s compelling to watch Nina&#8217;s compassion and sacrifice. It&#8217;s beautiful to see such strength in such a heartbreaking situation.The story is a mix of empowerment and heartache. My heart was shredded for Nina and her children. This isn&#8217;t a story where every problem is magically resolved by the end and everyone gets his or her happily ever after. This is a true depiction of real life. Things are messy and left open ended. I think anyone who finds himself or herself in a situation similar to Nina&#8217;s will find strength in her story. The plot is realistic and it&#8217;s obvious Nicole has done her research regarding this subject matter. It&#8217;s a difficult subject to address among a pool of literature where every ending is what fairy tales are made of, but I feel like the author nailed this. She took a chance on darker content and prevailed.I also loved the unique writing style in Shards of My Heart. It&#8217;s written as if the pages have been ripped straight out of Nina&#8217;s journal. The narration and dialogue are casual and conversational. It&#8217;s a unique take on writing and unlike anything I&#8217;ve seen. I think this less traditional style fits the characters and story &#8211; Nina is unapologetically bold just like this twist on the typical novel.

After two weeks and no luck (of course) I bit the bullet and padded the Bose bank account for another $300.There really is no alternative, years ago I tried cheap ($75) active noise cancellation which were useless, followed by not so cheap ($150 range) in-ear passive noise cancellation ear buds which were grossly uncomfortable and would not stay in my ears, until finally nirvana with the Bose QC3. One caveat I must mention is that I will not play music through anything with the Bose name on it. Music and Bose are an oxymoron, in my opinion. For music I have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880, that is a headphone for music. No, my QC3s are for noise cancellation and voice (as in movies, audiobooks and podcasts) period. Also I do agree with a couple other posts that there is a sensation of pressure with the headphones on and you are not playing anything through the headphones. I can stand it but its not all that pleasant. Finally no I don't care that I can't use the headphones when they are turned off. The battery is more than ample for a 13hr flight over the Pacific. It was my first time in a Boeing 777 and that plane is just as noisy at altitude as a 737, thankfully I had my QC3s. In short, I love these headphones for my use model. It's really five stars for how the QC3s suit my use not because they are the best headphones on the planet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "can't live without...", "unixReviewTime": 1269475200, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2010"}

The one thing that we dislike about the episodes is the of sexual encounters where too much skin is shown.  Fortunately there is not a lot of this type of exposure and so we are able to continue to watch this series.I cannot give this series a 5 star as there are negative points. The show is entertaining and builds the characters to where you can see the chemistry between people and relationships. The main character is not perfect, he has his own human charismatic weakness however he is a good cop with good intentions and looks out for his associated friendly relationships, sticking up for other policemen or policewoman, encouraging proper ways of life, though he has some of his own short comings which he is working out as well.Overall this is a good show to watch.  Though it may be something for a more mature audience.  Not necessarily something I would recommend for family with young kids. The violence seems to be real life type events and is not too excessive however, it is still present. There are a lot of worldly exposures presented as only can be expected as this is a cop show. The struggles each character experiences seems to be realistic.We have just finished season 1 and are now continuing to season 2 and hope to watch all of the NYPD Blue seasons and then will need to find another good show to watch. If the seasons become too violent or too much sexual exposure then we will discontinue our watching of the series.

He even claims to be Michael Collins from time to time and makes a habit of escaping from pursuers by way of the Dublin underground sewers.  Henry joins the IRA not so much for its revolutionary cause as for a means of somehow getting revenge for the extreme poverty that pervades his existence.  In fact, it soon becomes clear that the IRA is a haven for boys with a thirst for bloodshed, violence and close calls with death, not to mention food, clothes and firearms.  Henry's one-legged father worked as a bouncer for a brothel and also performed the occasional hit for an unseen thug.  Henry finds himself doing similar dirty deeds for the not-so-poverty-stricken leaders of the IRA and realizes that the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree.  When a friend is targeted for termination, Henry begins to re-evaluate the path his life has taken.  His distaste for killing marks him as an enemy of the IRA as well, and he has to go into hiding once again.  Sometimes I enjoy a good testosterone-y read, but in this case I never really understood what was the purpose of all the fighting.  At first, the insurrectionists didn't even have popular support, and later it became obvious that the IRA were vastly outnumbered and under-equipped, lacking airpower and organization.  All they really had was passion, and sometimes that seemed to be aimed in the wrong direction.  Even after a compromise was reached with the British, the Irish leaders admitted that change was going to be minimal.  Then I suppose infighting led to the Irish Civil War.  At least I knew that Henry was going to live to inhabit two sequels.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "IRA henchman", "unixReviewTime": 1333324800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2012"}

Since getting this Internet radio I have spent about 6 weeks trying to trouble shoot what is essentially a failed device. Initially I was very happy to deal with the tech support people as they were in the USA and I was happy about that. I once did tech support for a software company and all our jobs went off shore. That said, I became very frustrated with the lack of support I was actually getting. \"Above, was the first paragraph of my initial review of the NP2900 which I held back posting. I could not believe Philips actually wanted me to review such a faulty device. It was very frustrating making call after call all to no avail. Eventually a replacement was sent to me which exhibited the same problem as the first. It refused to play any radio station labeled \"USA Only\". Being in Los Angeles, I knew that had to be a mistake. Well FINALLY after all the calls and a letter I wrote to corporate in Georgia , about a week or so ago a firmware update was sent to the radio. Now it plays USA Only stations with all the rest that it should.  It doesn't play UK Only stations, and it shouldn't, for me.  I don't know why it took so long and no one in support ever actually helped me directly but maybe in some small way my nagging got an engineer assigned to fix it.All that said what we have here is now, a pretty nice Internet Radio/Music streaming device.  I personally also have the Logitech SqueezeBox Boom. It is one of the most direct competitors for the 2900. Both are fine examples of what such a player should be. They both capture Internet radio broadcasts via a WiFi signal and can also stream music from your computer via a home network connected to the WiFi router. Each comes with accompanying software to facilitate this. The Philips includes Twonky Media Server which installs and finds and sends your music (and cover art!) to the 2900. I found the software works fairly well, but having a Squeezebox it can interfere with that software. You can also (on a PC) use \"Orb\", a free media streamer if you have issues with Twonky.An issue that I continued to have with the 2900 was slow scrolling through menus. Well, TODAY there was another firmware update. Boy, those engineers are getting their \"busy\" on! This one fixes that issue and adds some WiFi security features and graphics.Graphics, that's where the 2900 shines. Its screen is quite nice and in full color. The Boom uses blue/green characters only. Color is nice and it can use graphics to identify radio stations or as wallpaper or album art for your music collection. This is very cool and well executed.The remote control is a \"typical\" lots of little buttons, remote. I wound up adding the radio to my Harmony 880 remote and prefer to use it to control the functions, especially at night as the original remote is not backlit. There are only four basic controls on the player itself.  On the unit's top are Power, Mute,  Volume Up & Down. That's it. I wish it had more but that's a design choice. The result is a very sleek minimalist radio face.  It is a very \"pretty\" radio and will add a touch of style to your room. It also sounds VERY GOOD. The speakers are more than decent and can fill a good size room with nice rich sound.A couple of minor annoyances are that it only has Rhapsody as a supported music service. They do include a free trial month but you have to subscribe thereafter. The Boom has a very large assortment of music services that it supports both free and pay. The other main annoyance is how to \"surf\" the radio section. The 2900 is radio \"station\" centric. Meaning you can find stations by searching for their location or by call letters.  The Boom let's you find out who's on now. As in I want to listen to Talk/Progressive and it will list who is on now and you can then tune to whatever station that person is on right now, wherever they are.  I find that system far more useful. You can still search for an actual station from your home town, but overall, to me, the Boom wins on usefulness.  I think this is a software issue and hope Philips sees fit to address it in a future update.When you play music stored on your computer, first it needs to be DRM free.

But that laptop died and now I have a new laptop with XP, and when I try to play Scrabble 2 on it, I just get a black screen that freezes my system.  The problem may be the DirectX version in XP (version 9, maybe?), which would not let me write over itself with the version that comes with Scrabble 2 (version 6.1, I think).  And God only knows what other things on my machine would quit working if I were succesful at replacing the newest DirectX with an older version.

The legislative section is compiled by the Police National Legal Database (PNLD) and focuses on police powers, procedures and terrorism offences.  When we met the authors at the launch, the usp emphasis of the Handbook rests with the excellent `points to note' and case studies which give that blend of field support which is clearly so well needed to police this area of crime today.Lord Carlile, who, in 2001, became \"Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation\", explains in the Foreword that the highly experienced authors of this excellent book have drawn together the body of counter-terrorism legislation in a form accessible to all stakeholders.This Handbook which he describes as being designed for police officers will undoubtedly attract attention and interest from a much wider readership, including Ministers, civil servants and lawyers and all aspects of the security services.  Carlile draws particular attention to the extensive use of case studies, the 'what-really-happened-when' challenge of  the terrorism landscape and as such, an invaluable and certainly crystal clear training resource for specialist and non-specialist officers alike.Lord Berriew's particular concern, however, is one which we suggest the majority of the British public share and wholeheartedly endorse when he says that terrorism law should be used only for terrorism purposes- how right he is and we know where it hasn't followed this road.  He continues, saying that every step outside those purposes provides terrorists with an argument.  All in authority are required never to forget that such laws are a step outside the norms of criminal justice legislation.Such expedients as stop and search...cordoning off specific areas...accessing details of a bank account and so forth, should be used with the utmost caution.  Misused or abused, they and similar measures can escalate into serious infringements of cherished, hard-won freedoms within a democracy.  Consider, for example, the controversial proposal to introduce compulsory ID cards now discarded, which of course, two out of our three mainstream political parties opposed until the government capitulated, generally citing grounds that ID cards, traditionally the tool of the traditional police state, are a major threat to personal freedom and a very minor threat to the determined terrorist.Just to digress a bit, this reminds us of a quote from Benjamin Franklin that appeared in the Times `Letters' page a couple of years ago to the effect that `those who would sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither freedom nor safety.'  Hmmn - we think Ben was right and, as the problems of terrorism affect us all, we can safely recommend this fascinating and authoritative handbook, not just to the professionals involved, but to the general reader as the ideal resource for modern physical and covert security issues in the modern world.ISBN: 978-0-19-955980-0YouTube[...]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AN IDEAL PRACTICAL RESOURCE FOR POLICE OFFICERS...", "unixReviewTime": 1247356800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2009"}

What I quickly learned is having ideas did not, and does not, separate me from anyone else. Most people I meet have lots of ideas too. And most of the time those ideas are better than mine.But Mike did not have ideas. He had experience. He had gone through the hard work of practicing his ideas for decades, and - no surprise - had learned a lot. And I quickly learned that he was more than willing to share what he had learned with everyone. The beauty is what he learned was tremendously simple. But don't let that fool you.In its simplicity it proves to be tremendously difficult.Because it's not about doing what's always been done. Rather it's about doing what Jesus wants done. We've made the Christian life somewhat complex and easy to live. Jesus' teaching was simple and difficult to live. This is due to the fact that the way of Jesus - what he called the Kingdom - was more a movement and less an organized religion.This is what Mike has tapped into. What he speaks about is not just his experience, but also the experience of many others. The movement of which he spoke is something that has shaped and reshaped the lives of thousands, and has continued to do just that up to the present moment.After all, it's about the Kingdom. It was here long before us and will go on long after us too. The question is not about its longevity, but whether we will join with God's work on earth. This is what his latest book Leading Kingdom Movements is about. It is shared experience that will give you greater understanding into joining, forming and leading something that will long outlast any of us.The best part of this book is that it does not crush anyone's ideas, or hamper idealism. Just the opposite. What I have found to be true about Mike is that his experience lends greater traction to the people's ideas. I have found this to be true in my own life as a person, a disciple and a pastor. And this book is proof of that.If you feel like you have lots of ideas and want to see them move from theory to practice then you need to buy this book, read it, read it again and then give it to those you know who have all sorts of ideas. Because if we're honest; ideas do not change the world - acting on ideas changes the world.And when we do that, we'll find ourselves in the midst of a movement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beyond Ideas", "unixReviewTime": 1362441600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2013"}

Also, like all X10 equipment you should not expect it to work relably considering several interference factors from modern appliances already plugged into the power grid of your home that can cause the signal to be cancelled out or lost.  I have learned over the years to only rely on X10 for devices on the same circuit using both the transmitter and the receiver.

I have been having increasingly severe back pain for over a year.  I have seen every form of doctor and therapist with virtually no relief.  My neurosurgeon told me the only remaining option for me is surgery and I really don't want to do that.

I have been doing it for 4 days now, and I have to say, I am feeling better.  There are moments of pain and discomfort during the routine, but I can feel something being released in my lower spine, and I get a bit of a warm glow after I finish.  I am not in pain at night, which was the worst issue for me; I have slept for the last three nights!  I am still having some aches and pains during the day, but it is definitely better.

A boy could not go to a girl's house without her permission, but at times changed the guy began to take the authority from the girl.  Dating was what was causing the changes of courtship.  It moved the girl and the boy outside the home and created a shift from the parlor at the girl's house.  Examples would be the replacing of the girl's house with the car.Bailey's book is great for reading and will take only a day to finish (143 pages).  Also, it is a really nice looking book.

They aren't large enough in circumference to go completely over the ears, so I find myself wanting to reposition the headset often.The headsets have no high end and give audio quality much like that of the original VHS system way back when. This is too bad because while traveling in a car, it's the high end that you need most to overcome road noise. There is no audio noise (hiss or hum). The volume control on the headset is easy to use and the channel selection is indicated with bright red and green LEDs, so you won't have to turn on a light to be sure you are on the channel you want. Thankfully, you can turn the headsets off to conserve the AAA batteries. The LED's that provide the infrared light for communicating with the headsets are not bright to the eye, so will not be distracting when viewing video in a dark car or room.The transmitter is small, light and easily placed. You could stick it just about anywhere with some Velcro.I'm using this system in a house, not a car, so I had to go to Radio Shack and get an AC adapter to provide 12volts converted from 115VAC (that was another $20 for me to spend).

The most indicting criticism in the book warns Christians of the danger of living inside an \"ideological bubble.\" The advent of the Internet has given us access to an ideological bubble of our own choosing, despite the availability of any viewpoint we can imagine. We have an infinite smorgasbord of choice at our fingertips: 24-hour television news, websites, blogs, Facebook groups, YouTube channels. It's all there for us to pick and choose our tastes. Add this to a second major problem--the seduction of sound bites--and we've got a recipe for trouble. Bring these sound bites into the church, and we produce Christians with an appetite not for theological depth but for tasty nuggets of truth: \"We want preachers who can give us catchy phrases that capture our imaginations and that move us emotionally; whether or not the catchy phrases are particularly accurate becomes quite secondary in the process.\"Hijacked proposes several ways to get back to the essential call to love each other. This is what Jesus expects. Both individuals and local churches have a responsibility to work hard against the tendency to divide, because the more we divide and spend our time on \"our side,\" the more the Church becomes split into an \"us\" versus \"them\" mentality.Hijacked addresses a problem most of us would admit exists, yet we would all hesitate to admit we are part of the problem. So, let's admit it: at some level we are all part of the problem. As much as I wish to believe my libertarian ethics, theology, and politics are an alternative \"third way\" that allows more freely the work of the Kingdom, even I am not exempt from being stubborn at times.

This video is GREAT for someone like me who needs to strengthen his or her back and abdominal muscles while not further injuring anything. I'm a very physical person who loves to work on my car and motorcycle as well as our house but would be in excruciating pain by the end of the day. After religiously following the two routines daily in this video I am for the most part pain free (and in a much better mood). I'm still aware of the pain in my lower back, but it's quite a bit better and I'm sure that it will subside the stronger my back becomes. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has suffered like I have. It is a great place to start from if your back has lost its ability to maintain its flexibility and strength.

This will not fit into the hole (didn't on our unit)...However, you can get it started and there is enough threaded portion of the bolt sticking out the other side of the pipe to get the nut started by hand.

Slight spoilers may be ahead if you haven't read the other books. And if you haven't read them, shame on you. Get to it!!After Eve finds out that she is the one and only person or thing that can save the 0.12% left of the human race, she goes on a mission with the help of Dr. Evans, West, Avian, and Bill to go back to where it all started: NovaTor Biotics. This facility is not only where Eve was saved and turned into a hybrid, it's also where the apocalypse of the human race started. Nobody is thrilled to be going but it's imperative that they find the tools and codes necessary to take out the billions of Bane, once and for all.Eve was once again fantastic. She finally has an absolute sense of purpose. She knows that she's the key to everything and it gives her such a sense of strength and determination. She finally knows exactly who she is supposed to be with and the emotional and physical drama that happened between her, West, and Avian is over. Her and Avian's relationship was lovely and I loved the tender moments they shared with each other when s*** wasn't hitting the fan. She also is no longer struggling with her emotions and feelings. I almost forget that she was this crazy and awesome human-TorBane hybrid.The plot was exactly what I love about this series: thrilling, intense, scary, and full of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. It's nonstop action and kept me glued to the \"pages.\" On their journey, Eve had a sense of dread that everything was going too easy and that something bad was bound to happen. I hated when she mentioned this because then I started to get uneasy too.One thing that Taylor knows how to do is surprise the crap out of us and leave us hanging onto her every word to know what is going to happen and how it's going to end. I was never expecting the ending that she wrote. It was happy (which I didn't expect) and then the next page I start bawling my eyes out. I literally cried for the last 20% of the book. (SPOILER!!) Unlike ALLEGIANT, Taylor knows how to kill off a main character. It was done so much better. SO much better.(END OF SPOILER) This ending felt complete, purposeful, and despite tearing me apart emotionally, it felt right. And then the last thing I ever thought to happen happened!If you haven't read this series, I strongly urge you to! Yes, the first book is filled with Eve's emotional struggles between two people she thinks she loves. But as Eve's story progresses, she comes into her own, learns how to be more human, and how to differentiate between love and friendship. THE EVE was exactly the ending to Eve's story that was needed. It was exactly the ending to everyone's story in New Eden that was needed. It sewed up every loose end, gave each character we came to love an ending best fit for them, and it completely concluded Eve's transformation from a lost girl with no sense of who she was or why she was here to a strong, capable, brave, and loved girl who knows what it means to have a family. Taylor knows how to conclude a trilogy and did it perfectly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic end to a heart-pounding series!", "unixReviewTime": 1386288000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2013"}

I like that it has a large velcro closure rather than a magnetic one, as I'm kind of active and jostle around a bit. The use of the included carabiner is actually preferable to me, over the clip, as it allows for more freedom for the phone to get out of my way, when I want it to, but I latch it to one of the tangs of the clip, rather than the small ring and fabric binding, which seems flimsy by comparison.

I must say that even with the creation of NYPD Blue, nothing has in my mind.  However, this does not mean that Blue is not as compelling as Hill Street in its storytelling, cinematography, ensemble acting, brilliant writing and plot characterization.  The core of the show rests in the way cases are intertwined with the personalities of the characters.  What facinates me is the varied and complex range of each character, especially Andy Sipowitz.  He above all the other characters personafies the struggle of finding ones true self through the personal demons within.  With that said you can't help but love the guy because through the rough and tough surface appearance, he is a dedicated cop and a good person that can see the best in others more readily than he can see in himself.The first two seasons are classic in the way the characters are brought to life so that each is identifiable to the audience in such a way that you feel their expierence personally.  Add to this the superb storytelling and camera work and you have TV worth watching which says a lot considering there is very little to see these days.  Although recent seasons are not as compelling as the first two (what shows are?), I still find myself glued to channel seven (NY) partly based on those first two seasons.Accordingly, it is my feeling that season one and two are a must for anyone who appreciates great acting, brilliant writing, and exceptional storytelling.

I am primarily a Java J2EE developer and have had limited Mac Dev experience and almost all of it was pre OSX.  I knew I was going to need a book that could get me up to speed as quickly as possible.  After stalking the programming aisle at my local books store, I selected this book as I had heard good things about The Big Nerd Ranch, and I also grabbed a copy of iPhone in Action as I had used a few different \"In Action\" books for J2EE projects.  Both books seemed to cover a lot based on a quick scan of the table of contents.  However after actually flipping through a few chapters in each book I got the impression that the Big Nerd Ranch guide was presenting things in a building block format with a lot of example code and graphical illustrations.  The iPhone In Action book seemed more wordy and didn't seem to have as much sample code.  I decided to take this book home and after working through the chapters and slowly building up from simple apps to slightly more complex ones I really got a feeling for the sdk and patterns to get stuff done.  I got my project done in very short order and am very happy with the whole experience.  Great book to learn iPhone development and Objective-C basics.

I am a professional firearms instructor by trade, so I expected that the \"gun talk\" would appeal to me.

His description of his efforts to set up training regimens and marksmanship standards among his peers was very interesting. His encounters with smugglers and bandidos on the border kept me turning pages quickly.There were a few riveting accounts of close encounters with German troops in WW2 and a few more accounts of dangerous dealings with the Viet Minh in the early days of the US involvement in Viet Nam, but, by and large, the multiple chapters devoted to his duties in the US Army Ordnance were a big yawn. The author admitted to such on several occasions.Askins loved to hunt and to shoot animals. He claimed that he did not wish to see an animal suffer, so he was an \"ethical\" hunter. There were some serious contradictions to his claim, however. He shot Indian's horses, just for kicks in the early part of the book, for example.If you are not a hunter, you will most likely not want to read the latter half of the book. Huge numbers of animals were taken by Askins over the years.I think this would have been a better piece of literature had it been put together as a series of short stories, not an autobiography.

I won a copy of this book a while back fromA thousand Wrongs. I just read it and I loved it. haha. The character is in the 6th grade, just starting her first year of middle school, and thinks she is unattractive and dorky. She is frizzy haired, freckle- faced, and now she has to deal with wearing this unbearably hideous reading glasses? life just got complicated.Wait. hold up, that wonky eye doctor gave  her a pair of glasses that can read the thoughts of anyone she is looking at? junk just got interesting.now she can find out why her best (and only) friend is treating her so badly and maybe even make a few new friends while she is at. But with great power comes great responsibility. There are more important things to worry about than spying on your best friend's thoughts or trying to figure out what your long- time crush thinks of you. She has to learn what to do with her new found talent for acting (ere go the role in the school play of Cinderella), her wayward father, and that name calling bully, Charlie. And maybe even get the chance to help with something bigger than she is.This book is very safe for younger audiences and explores the world of junior high, around that crucial time where you are breaking with old childhood friendships and developing deeper and more lasting friendships. We all remember starting middle school and having crushes. i remember all too well having the friends that were prettier than I was (hey, its true. cannot be helped) and that all the boys went after. I could really relate to Callie. I mean, I wish my dorky glasses served a higher purpose than just vision correction. Okay, I am nineteen, so i can relate to Callie when I was in middle school. lol.This book was pretty deep in some senses though. You are sort of opened up to the harsh reality of fake friendships and one- sided friendships. Thinks that can be life changing to girls (and boys) at that age.I love how Callie finally stood up to her friend when she was pushing her around and calling her selfish, even though Callie was trying her hardest to be the best friend she could be. You can only do so much in a friendship with a person who thinks enough is never enough. By the way, red hots were my dads favorite candy. :) brings back some memories. I loved that part of the story. torn between whether to rate this book with red hots or silly glasses. :) We shall see.I think I may lend this book to my niece when she is just a little bit older. she is almost ten now, so she is around Callie's age. I do not know how my sister will feel about me giving her a book full of such realities just yet, Andi does not really talk a lot about friends. good lord, I do not even know who my niece's best friend is (it's me, of course).

Many people feel a disconnect with the world as presented to them by science. They feel, at a gut level, that there is something more and in shamanism they hope to find a path that can lead them to that other something.This is not a book of do-it-yourself instructions for becoming a shaman but a look at the history and practice of shamanism, its many varieties and the ideas that underlying it.  Dr. Walsh takes you by the hand and gently leads you through the subject dealing with vision quests, journeys to other worlds, altered states of consciousness, spirit helpers and beliefs. He effortlessly combines anthropology, psychology, and psychiatry with a smattering of New Age thought while grounding his writings in scientific research as much as possible. He carefully documents his sources to produce, if nothing else, a truly awesome bibliography. Yet he writes in a manner that anyone can understand keeping his discussions short, crisp and to the point.Yet for all of this he manages a fluidity of thought and breath of view that will make many scientists uncomfortable. What comes off as New Age thinking or even crackpot thinking is actually the thinking of a man ahead of his time. For he has the insight, or perhaps the humility, to realize that science is not the only game in town. In shamanism we have an alternate way of looking at the world, one far older than the scientific view. In his discussions of the nature of consciousness, altered states of being and the world as the shaman sees it he does a valuable service to science by pointing to areas of thought that many scientists dismiss to easily.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Shamanism Today", "unixReviewTime": 1237248000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2009"}

Eight-year-old Vada virtually grew up overnight and raised her three younger sisters while her father lost himself in his medical practice in the basement of their home.Now, Vada is a grown woman, still making her home with her father and sisters. Her days are spent serving as an errand girl for Cleveland's fledgling amateur orchestra; her evenings with Garrison Walker, her devoted, if passionless, beau.Dizzying change occurs the day the Brooklyn Bridegrooms come to town to play the Cleveland Spiders and a line drive wallops the head of a spectator. The fan is whisked to the Allenhouse parlor, and questions swirl about the anonymous, unconscious man.Suddenly, the subdued house is filled with visitors, from a flirtatious, would-be sports writer to the Bridegrooms' handsome star hitter to the guilt-ridden ballplayer who should have caught the stray shot. The medical case brings Dr. Allenhouse a frustration and helplessness he hasn't felt since his wife's disappearance. Vada's sisters are giddy at the bevy of possible suitors. And Vada's life is awakened amid the super-charged atmosphere of romantic opportunity.I began reading this book and was enthralled right away. I enjoyed the characters and the escapades they engaged in. While there were some slow moments, I mostly thought Allison Pittman did a good job writing a fun story and easy read.

At first I was planning on getting the black one that disappeared from the internet back in December.  The other canvas model's did not suit me.  Too bold, or too casual (military model).  Not to mention I really liked the layout of the dial with the date at the 4 position.  Thus freeing up a nice looking  12, 3, 6, and 9 numbers on the dial face.  This arrangement makes for a very pleasing appearance to the eye and allows you to quickly tell the time with just a glance.  In order to fit the chronograph also, they made the watch big.  It is a full 46mm across.  I have a small wrist and so the watch fits in the third hole from the end.  Everyone seems to be wearing big watches now though.  I have gotten used to it and like the size more now.I gave it 5 stars because I WILL NEVER HAVE TO BUY A BATTERY AGAIN!  Well besides that, the mechanical functions feel solid and keeps very accurate time.  As soon as I got it and pushed in the crown it started working (even though it had been in the box not exposed to the light).

I also have a self-winding watch, and I would have to set the time every time I wanted to pick it up.  Not with this Citizen though!  You pick it up and it works!  I do like the color also. The sturdy canvas band looks almost like a leather band from a distance.  This color goes good with just about anything.

From his radio show on Power!Talk Radio and his books, he has made the best of life and is able to go through life's challenges, with all of its ups and downs, with a positive outlook.\"Every Moment Matters: Savoring the Stuff of Life\" is a book in which St. Augustine shares with people stories from his life and how he was able to savor those moments.  May it be happy or sad, reading this book was an entertaining, uplifting, and inspiring read because through the moments that we live in our hectic lives, there are things that we can savor.  You just need that moment in time to look back and see it.For example, in the opening chapter titled \"Big Jake\", St. Augustine writes about a dog he saw caged and brought it back to his home.  Through the challenges of living with Jake's constant howling, to trying to give him to a new home (but the owners not being able to take his constant howling) and, as years passed by, Jake had become part of his life and then part of John's married life, and then through his older age, including taking Jake to his old playground in the forest during their first year, and then having to take the dog to the vet to be put to sleep.In the chapter \"From a Distance\", St. Augustine writes about an experience when he and a large group of family and friends were in town for a family reunion.  But on that day, a tragic accident happened in which he and other people at the party ran to the scene to see if they can help.  What he saw were tragedies but also children who had a chance to live, and he and others did what they could to rescue the kids pinned in the vehicle.  He writes of how each time he sees an accident now, what he experienced stays in his head.  But most of all, he is grateful to be alive himself.  Many people take for granted just the mere act of being alive and healthy, even though the fragility of life can change at a moment's notice.In another chapter titled \"The Naked Men's Club\", St. Augustine talks about going into a sauna with a few of his guy friends.  The circumstances of how the friendship began with two of the men is inspiring.  Two of the fathers were brought together from the death of their teenage kids who were hit by a logging truck.  The two men who were not close friends before, but were brought together in the most tragic of circumstances.  It is a friendship that has been a big part of John St. Augustine's life.There are several personal stories that John St. Augustine shares with the readers, but it is a reflection of how we should be grateful for life and, also, appreciating the people around you and how inspiring people can make a big difference in our lives.Overall, I enjoyed this book.  Sometimes, we are all so busy with our work and daily routines that we do not take time out to savor and appreciate the simple things more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Savor and appreciate your life!", "unixReviewTime": 1271894400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2010"}

Peter Sellers offscreen could be a monster to those around him, but this was all part of his many moods. A man-child with no distinct personality of his own, he found himself only through the roles he took on (Dr. Strangelove, Inspector Clouseau, Chauncy the Gardener).Ed Sikov's book, which I read about a year ago, recounts all the triumph and tragedy, angst and ecstasy, and the many contradictions of Sellers the man and movie star. It reads like a sympathetic but unbiased take on the man and his work. Sikov goes at great length to show not only the horrible things that Sellers did, but also the wonderful things he did on occasion (while tempering this with the knowledge that Sellers expected much in return). I doubt a more honest and yet tender portrait of the man could be written.Sikov doesn't shy from Sellers's problems, but he offers some insight into why they might have come to be: a distant father, a needy mother, and relatives who indulged the young boy, all the way to his last wife's abuse of their estate in order to kill herself with drugs. Throughout it all, Sellers is the central figure around which madness unravels, and unravele him as well. You come away from it feeling pity for Sellers because of the circumstances which contributed to his madness, but mindful as well of the lives he touched (for good or bad) with his talent and ego.You won't find yourself embracing Sellers when you finish the book, but you won't find yourself eager to rid him from your pantheon of comedy heroes either. Peter Sellers was a walking contradiction, and Ed Sikov does his best to expose the many faces Sellers showed not only to the world at large but to those he loved in particular.

Although they are quite comfortable, they break easily if you are traveling with them or take them to work every day you should expect to have to replace them shortly. Once the plastic underneath the cushon cracks you are SOL  and have to spend another $35  to replace them.  The warranty is not exactly what I would call adequate either as they say that the ear piece warranty only lasts 6 months while the headphone warranty is 1 year.  This tells me that they already know  that they area shipping out a product with flimsey construction, the question is - why don't they just use more durable materials in the first place?  Obviously, the answer is that they want you to keep buying replacements.#2 - All the accessories are over priced.  Fortunately I haven't lost anything from the origional box,  but  if you lose the little detachable cord that goes from the headphones to the stereo jack  you are out another $25 for something that would be  1.99-4.99 at radio shack if not for the fact that it plugs into the head phones at a wierd angle, no doubt so the customer can not find a generic cord anywhere else.#3 - The battery takes a really long time to charge compared to other batteries on the market these days.Again...  the product does what it is supposed to,  but  for  almost $400  i would rather not have the design flaws mentioned in #1, and dramatic markups for common or cheaply manufactured \"accessories\" should anything break or go missing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not Bad, but not GOOD Either", "unixReviewTime": 1257120000, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2009"}

Almost as quickly as I could get this radio out of it's packaging, did I have it plugged in and playing music from our wireless network.I skipped past the instructions initially and was able to get everything up and running just by playing around with the remote (took only a few minutes).  Later on, I skimmed through the accompanying manual, which is extremely easy to read and highlights all of the important points that would be pertinent to a new user.I haven't yet activated my month free Rhapsody subscription and chances are I probably won't.  My boyfriend has quite the collection on his MacBook and Laptop and the free stations that we're able to pick up are more than enough to keep us satisfied.  The only difficulty we've experienced with playing music from our laptops is that we haven't figured out a way to access files from a shared external drive (not even sure if this is an option).One minor inconvenience is that the radio will occassionally queue for an extended period of time (like forever...).  This seems to happen most often when trying to use the search feature and there doesn't appear to be a way to cancel a request once it's been submitted.  Holding the power button down does not force a restart.  The only solution I've found has been to completely power down the device by unplugging the power supply for a few moments.  If anyone has a better solution to this or can explain how I can prevent this problem from occuring in the first place, it would be greatly appreciated.Included in the box is your radio, remote (which you'll 'need'), a stand as well as an optional wall mount.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quick and Easy Setup.

Unconstitutional actually directed by Renny de la Pena, is the outstanding documentary.  It blows one away!  It documents the loss of civil liberties after 9.11 by the Bush Administration.  I watched it with a tense feeling in my throat.  The law and the rights of Americans placed in the Constitution is very valuable to me.  This movie shows how much we have lost and it threatens our democracy.  The second best documentary is OUTFOXED about the bias in Fox News.  I agree with the assessment that Fox News is very biased but lately I would argue that the bias has spread to MSNBC, CNN and many news shows as they vie for ratings and popularity.  There is constant movement, noise, shouting and arguing in all news networks, yet real analysis and information is missing.  There are topics that are dismissed or not even addressed.  The loss of newspapers where most good reporting has gone on has contributed to the decline.  The third documentary was not very good in my opinion.  Uncovered is a frenetic and busy documentary about how Americans were lied to by their politicians before deciding to invade Iraq.  The extended interviews in the extra features section are far more insightful and interesting than anything in the movie which is confusing and one is very happy when it ends.

You will make two HTML webpages and accompanying Cascading Style Sheets (standard for formatting webpages). This two page website will have a home page and one inner page. From just these two webpages you can go on to create an entire website by creating any number of inner pages.Castro begins by telling you what you will need to complete the project and then she jumps right in with the bare bones HTML webpage. She then starts to add the images and text that are the main focus of the book. She first shows you how to add a simple image to the webpage and how to make a navigation bar from a few small images. She then shows how to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to position this navigation bar on the webpage and control the appearance of the navigation links.Castro then moves on to demonstrate CSS more thoroughly. She starts with formatting and positioning text on a webpage. She then shows how to divide a webpage into sections and how to control the position and appearance of each section with the CSS.Once you have completed your two webpages, you are ready to publish to the web. Castro discusses hosting your site and FTP software for transferring your webpage onto the web.Castro has included some useful charts at the end of the book which contain the HTML and CSS code used in the project, HTML color and special character codes.

It successfully initializes the CC3000 by sending SimpleLinkStart, then acquires available buffer size through ReadBufferSize. My driver successfully synchronizes all the traffic over the SPI channel (CS from Host to CC3000 and IRQ from CC3000 to Host), I receive the \"Keep Alive\" unsolicited event every 10 seconds etc. It features a decoupled model that effectively separates calls among layers, but when I call \"HCI_CMND_READ_SP_VERSION (0x0207)\" it returns a code that indicates that no patch is available at the device (0xFF: according to some TI forums), so it comes with the whole bunch of flaws at ROM. I tried to patch the device many many many times over SPI by sending the HCI_TYPE_PATCH, sending portions with their respective length bytes (in little-endian) lower or equal to 1000 bytes per portion, and I tried by sending all the opcodes (0x00, 0x01, 0x02 even 0x03 to 0x0A after desperation) but..., NNH (nothing never happened).

Backed by an 18-piece band, Phil Collins covers the soul and Motown classics that he loved as a teenager.  This is not a concert of Phil Collins songs - he describes this production as  \"a Phil Collins blu-ray with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it\".'Going Back - Live at the Roseland Ballroom' is a real chance to get up close and personal with Phil Collins as he covers the greats including  Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and William 'Smokey' Robinson.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESIf you enjoyRod Stewart's Great American Songbook series, then you'll certainly love Phil Collins' \"Going Back\".On this blu-ray, Phil Collins passionately recreates the soul and Motown classics that he listened to and loved since his early music days of being a drummer in his school band and subsequently joining the group Genesis in 1971.In September 2010, Phil released the audio CDGoing Backto complement this concert that took place in June 2010.Blu-Ray Track Listing:Intro: Signed, Sealed, DeliveredAin't Too Proud to BegGirl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)Dancing in the Street(Love Is Like a) HeatwavePapa Was a Rollin' StoneNever Dreamed You'd Leave in SummerJimmy MackYou've Been CheatingDo I Love YouLoving You Is Sweeter Than EverGoing to a Go-GoBlame It on the SunAin't That PeculiarToo Many Fish in the SeaYou've Really Got a Hold on MeSomething about YouThe Tears of a ClownNowhere to RunIn My Lonely RoomTake Me in Your Arms, Rock Me a Little WhileUptight (Everything's Alright)Going BackTalking about My BabyYou Can't Hurry LoveMy GirlBonus Features:Rehearsal footage with Phil CollinsInterview with PhilVIDEO: 1080i Widescreen 16x9 (1.78:1)AUDIO: Dolby True HD, DTS HD Master Audio, LPCM StereoRunning Time: 126 minutesPhil Collins really put his heart and soul in his rendition of \"Too Many Fish in the Sea\".\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" and \"The Tears of a Clown\" brought out the best in the 'The Funk Brothers' and the rest of Phil Collins' band, including members from his old pop group Genesis.I may be putting myself on a limb here, but Phil's lighter take on \"The Tears of a Clown\" is as good as William 'Smokey' Robinson himself!  Funk Brothers', Bob Babbitt plays the bass line here.  Babbit in fact, wrote and played the bass line for 'Smokey' Robinson 1967 original recording of \"The Tears of a Clown\"!  So, crank up the volume and enjoy this Motown hit which Phil Collins describes as having 'one of the most fantastic bass lines in a pop song'.\"Papa was a Rollin' Stone\" can only be seen as a great tribute to the songwriters Barrett Strong (rest his soul) and Norman Withfield.\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" - will have you dancing your blues away!With the last track \"My Girl\", the Roseland Ballroom turned into one big karaoke party, as Phil had everyone on their feet and singing.  You'll be doing the same long after the credits are posted!4.5 stars as 'a cover of soul and Motown Music'.  Phil's 'blue-eyed soul' voice is too soft for some of the tracks.5 Stars as 'A PHIL COLLINS BLU-RAY with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it'!If you love Motown, Soul, The Funk Brothers, Genesis and, of course Phil Collins, thenPhil Collins: Going Back - Live at the Roseland Ballroom NYC [Blu-ray] is a must have!RECOMMENDED: You'll also enjoy listening to this cover of 60's music by former ABBA singer Agnetha F&auml;ltskog:My Colouring Book.

Then when the unit was turned off then turned back on at a later date, it couldn't find ANY networked music.

As such, you have to be in view of the unit to make any adjustments with the remote.  The menus are a bit tedious as well.  Lots of flipping through pages of menus and trying to decipher which button does what.  Not impossible, but not very convenient either.  I though of putting the player on top of a dresser, but I would have to physically stand up and aim the remote to work the machine.  I'd rather just flip through the stations as I walk by.On the plus side, the display is very pretty.  The actual unit is attractive, and it can be wall mounted.  Very sharp presentation.  Still, it's got too many technical headaches to bother with in my opinion.

Parisi \"Robert and Heather Parisi\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "IN A NUTSHELL: 2 DRIVE-IN CLASSICS WHICH PLAYED TOGETHER IN 1959--> 1st Feature: 'The Killer Shrews' Directed by Ray Kellogg, 1959--->HOW DO YOU RATE A BAD MOVIE THAT ENTERTAINS?This movie somehow is terribly entertaining and I am not sure why. It does have monsters, mandatory in all epic B creature features, but what kind of monsters? Yes, special monsters! Giant killer shrews which are actually cute jumping puppies with silly rug-like rat suits. A best editing Oscar might have been won if anyone saw the movie when it was originally released, just for the way the scenes were cut just as the RAT PUPPIES were about to show their cute jumping puppy traits. Yes, if you watch the film closely you can actually see when these playful pups are about to show their true colors and betray their employers by jumping, licking and rolling over. Many an adult has enjoyed this seemingly forgettable flick enough to purchase it on DVD [after they wore out the VHS edition just like me]. What gives? Well, it can't be the plot. We can only be grateful to the filmmakers for not blaming atomic energy for this 1959 disaster, but would you believe that these mutant giant rats were part of a project to save the world from overpopulation? No, they were not supposed to eat the world's surplus people. You'll have to watch this epic to discover their true purpose. Warning, watching this terrible film can be contagious and habit forming. As a bonus, you can often find this classic on DVD mated to one of several promising epics of the same era. \"The Giant Gila Monster\" and \"The Crawling Eye\" are just the two I know about. I have a feeling there are more but you can't miss with either of these.--> 2nd Feature: The Giant Gila Monster, Directed by Ray Kellogg, 1959---> ONE CAN'T HELP THINKING OF THE BLOB WHEN WATCHING THIS CREATURE FEATURELike the 'Killer Shrews', 'The Gila Monster' takes itself seriously -- dead seriously. Watching this film makes my mouth water for an audience to lampoon this charming 50s creature-feature for, but that is just part of the fun. You see, this film approaches its subject with the same gothic intensity that the original 'Outer Limits' did in 1963-1964. The film opens with a missing couple, presumed to be eloping, but we all know otherwise. Gradually, the County Sheriff begans to notice the same pattern that the audience had, only a bit slower. People are disappearing and in increasing numbers. Since most of the adults are drunk in this film, especially the witnesses, it is up to the teenagers to assist the Sheriff in bringing this big lizard to justice.Okay, so it's a bit corny and cliche, probably even when it played to drive-in crowds in 1959: small crowds, but crowds to be sure. It is played in earnest and the tension does build. Unlike the first feature, this film seems a bit drawn out, perhaps to be long enough to play for European audiences looking for new eclectic American productions -- perhaps not. Anyway, it seems as though this would have made a neat 'Outer Limits' episode if it had been tightened-up at bit with editing. Maybe a couple of country tunes could have been omitted, or maybe the serenade was important for the atmosphere of the film -- in any event it seemed too long for a very short film. Maybe we could have seen more of the Gila Monster, which Ray Kellogg, a Special Effects A-List veteran, expanded from a 2 foot reptile into a 50-80 foot long behemoth rather convincingly. All the scenes showing the monster were miniatures, but a full-scale set was made to make the transition from mini-monster to actual set with people pretty real looking for a low-budget thriller. Of course we don't see people and the Gila Monster in the same frame. For that kind of magic in 1959, you'd need Ray Harryhausen and about 3 years of his time. The film does start with a bang and then gradually builds suspense to a Nitro charged conclusion which is after all, all we want from a Drive-In thriller.

The author starts out with the very basics showing you how to design a web page, telling you how you're going to do it and then taking you through all the steps one-by-one. There's a brief introduction to html and using css and then she jumps right in getting you to create a web page.There's lots of illustrations, and the html text and the css text are color coded so you know exactly where the author is at when giving instructions. It's a short book, only about 125 pages, but packed full of useful tips that only we *newbies* to web design can truly appreciate. At the end of the book is information on hosting, transfering files to the server and just some basics on getting started.The book only has you format two pages, but explains how to tweak this and tweak that using css. They're good, solid pages that just might survive the wrath of most browsers. You should have enough info to format more pages if you need them. I used my own images and have to admit that my pages looked just as good as the ones in the book.There is a somewhat lengthy section on formatting photos with Photoshop which I couldn't use as I don't have Photoshop, but the information clearly comes across that you do need to rework those photos to avoid lengthy download times.This would be a good beginner guide for someone wanting to put together some pages on their family, kid's softball team, vacation pixs, a short sight-seeing excursion, etc.Again, this is definitely for beginniners and remember that it doesn't begin to cover all aspects of html, css or page design, but it gives you the opportunity to turn something out that looks nice without getting too bogged down.I'm glad I bought the book as it certainly accomplishes what it set out to do.

These are certainly better at cancelling noise than the old ones. Sometimes when you wear them you might feel total silience around you, and at other times you might think that they are not even working at all.In general, they do reduce the noise. Most of the noise cancellation occurs at low frequencies, so the stuff that really gets shut out is the unnoticeable hummm that surrounds us all the time. We might not realize but around us, within an area of 5 miles, there are literally hundreds of thousands of devices, A/C units, computers, vehicles - everything that adds to that ever present humm. In a noisy city like new york, it can really add up, specially if you are in an office filled with computers.These headphones really work in those situations. It can be relieving to shut off that constant white noise.What I would like more from a product like this is the following: I would like Bose to come up with a product that is not a headphone but simply a noise reduction device. I feel there might be more potential (using the current technology) if they just concentrate on the noise cancellation part (of course they can sell the noise cancelling headphones as a separate product line).So to summarize, buy these headphones if you would like a little luxury. Dont expect them to be magic but they certainly help and certainly reduce noise. It is much more convenient to wear these headphones compared to anything else you can do to reduce noise (ear plugs, those tight huge ear muffs).Some people might also buy these headphones as a cool looking accessory for men. It is slightly geeky wearing a headphone in the subway, but they certainly look cool.Additional Update (Jan 08): These headphones are great for listening to music, specially if you are in a noisy environment. They will make the music more comfortable and there will be less masking in lower frequencies.Next, I have noticed that the head phones have a decent passive noise cancellation as well. By passive, we mean the noise that is reduced simply because the head phones cover the ears. This plays across all the frequencies, more on higher and mid frequencies. So there is noise reduction in all frequencies.Thirdly, active noise cancellation is very significant on super low frequencies. That's why if you are in a noisy environment with lots of those \"silent\" humms, these headphones will work great. However, noises that produce audible humms like the fan noise of a near by computer, these head phones won't do that much because it is slightly above the low frequencies level that active noise cancellation really works against.This means that some times you might feel that these headphones have really silenced the environment, at other times you might feel that they are not doing much. It all depends on the composition of the total sound reaching you. But nevertheless, at all times, these head phones will significantly reduce the noise reaching you, whether you are able to appreciate that or not.On a comfort level, these head phones so soft, it is almost pleasurable to wear them. They are great for office.Another note on the music quality is that the sound from these headphones is certainly warm and rich. They have depth and fullness of sound that you would expect from such high-end headphones. Might not be for people who want true replication (monitor headphones), but these headphones feel much better than any other's I have heard including some professional sonys.Update (Feb 2008): These headphones are worth their weight in gold! Wonderful headphones. My office is so noisy, and putting on these headphones makes me feel like I'm in my own sanctuary. Quiet and suddenly the space is personal again. They do an amazing job of silencing the 'environment', just enough for you too feel that you are in your own quiet world.If you ever travel, even twice an year, these headphones will return their investment just because you can wear them while travelling. I cannot imagine how people air-travel with their uncovered ears. Once you remove these headphones, it's like you get shoked from the sudden burst of loud noise that blasts your ears. At the minimum any one traveling on a plane should wear some ear plugs!These are excellent headphones if you can afford them. Wonderful noise reduction. They even have a pretty decent passive noise reduction. Very useful.I highly recommend these headphones. Other than stuffing ear plugs in your ears, these headphones come pretty close to giving you relief from all this noise. And unlike ear plugs that are so uncomfortable, these are actually very comfortable. You can wear them for long periods without any problem.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good... certainly do something", "unixReviewTime": 1172188800, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2007"}

This paricular DVD, which claims to be 'digitally remastered' looks like a direct transfer from fair quality VHS tapes. At one point during &quot;Gila Monster&quot;, the tape slows and nearly grinds to a stop. And there is a slight pause between the two (yes, only two) chapter stops in each film.Worst of all, the creepy opening narration for &quot;The Killer Shrews&quot; is cut to only its last line! This 70-minute epic has been reduced to 68 minutes!Admittedly the video quality is fine and the sound is quite good on this disc, but in truth, you get what you pay for.Other reviews here have discussed the movies at length. Yes these are badly done movies, but &quot;Killer Shrews&quot; is still far superior to the &quot;Gila Monster&quot;. At least the shrews are entertaininly bad and, for this reviewer at least, the movie does generate a couple of real chills.

Of course I rather not to read others' criticisms until I actually get the product and try them myself.  So after receiving my pair of headphones I can loudly say that I do NOT agree with many of the criticisms of other reviewers.Most importantly, Bose Quiet Comfort 3 provides the best sound I've ever heard.  The stereo sound is breathtaking.  Never in my life have I heard so many sounds and instruments, many of which were usually tucked away in other sound systems.  Bose does a great job of revealing all the instrument parts.Because of its high resolution, however, the headphones can reveal the limitations of the original source recording.  Therefore, many monaural (non stereo) and poorly recorded recordings might not sound too good in headphones. Bose is for stereo sound, professionally recorded in the studio.  Any well-recorded piece of music will be enhanced in ways you might have not concieved with another kind of headphone.I feel that the noise cancellation feature is more than adequate.  Yes it doesn't completely block out extraneous sound, but I don't think it needs to do so.  When I'm wearing the headphones, I'd rather know what's going on in my surroundings.  I don't want to be totally unaware thru complete sound reduction.  Nevertheless, there is enough noise cancellation so you can hear the music from the headphones withoug too much distraction.I have yet to bring the headphones on an airplane, but I am sure they will be serviceable when the time comes.  By the way, I don't recall the sounds of the airplane being too oppressive!! (are they??!!??) I know that these headphones were designed for the air traveler in mind.But I still feel that the biggest noise problem on board are crying children, obnoxious tourists!!!  Therefore the noise cancellation feature works best to cancel out the obnoxious person sitting next to you.After about an hour of headphone time, I can say that they are comfortable.  NO EAR PAIN!!  Some people just might have sensitive ears.  But mine were fine.  It's a comfortable headphone.Bottom line:  save up some money or use that tax refund check to invest in an amazing piece of electronics.

Her jabs at Tony Blair are especially troubling because, what do her political opinions have to do with Rossini?  This kind of thing, unfortunately, brings the quality of the book down a couple of levels to just above mediocre.

There is little evidence for this.Also her reasons for ending the war in the Pacific centered too much on the Japan and the US. Yet others were involved. Possibly the Russian entering the war probably was more important to Japan surrender then the US bomb.Furthermore the US could not have offered Japan better terms at Potsdam without causing major political problems both internally and externally as she had agreed that Unconditional Surrender policy earlier with her allies at the Casablanca conference. Because of the bomb and the Russian entry into the war there was no reason to upset them.Also the losses in the Pacific conflict were producing about 20,000 deaths a day that were not US or Japan - some notable examples were the Chinese, Indonesians, Indo China, Burma etc. If the bomb speeded up the end of the war by one month it saved several 100,000's of these people too.

For starters, I'm an average consumer. No specially trained ear and not using it for studio purposes. I care about quality, sound and look. I live in NYC and the noise from the subway, traffic and city life were enough for me to buy a pair of noise cancelling headphones.  Went with Bose because they are a premier name and brand. I know that they stand behind their product. Plus, you can always find retailers who carry the products so you can test them out in the stores before buying etc.First, sound from the noise-cancelling versus regular headphones were astonishing. Really superior sound and QC'a literally create a small sound vacumm and reduces background noise dramatically.Second, between the QC2 and the QC3, go for the QC3 and here's why, for $50 more, you get:1) NEWER PRODUCT - the satisfaction of knowing that you bought the latest technology to date2) GREENER - you are getting a rechargeable battery (vs. triple A's that costs money to buy and constantly replace... not to mention, tossing batteries isn't environmentally friendly). QC3 also comes with the charger, that's plus the cost of not constantly replacing your battery is worth more than the $503) WEIGHT - QC3 is lighter than the QC24) COMFORT - It doesn't go over your ear like the QC2 (great for people who wear glasses). Plus even without the over the ear design, the QC3 still creates a vacumm to block out noise without the headphones being so large that it will press against the frams of my glasses (hard to cope with when you are on a 12+ hour flight)5) LOOK - the shape of the QC3 looks better around your head.  Look carefully, the QC2 has this unattractive slight bulge where the headpiece sticks further out than in the QC2.  For a girl like me, I thought the QC2 made it look more masculine, bulky and \"street tough\".  The QC3 definitely has a more streamlined lookI bought my QC3 from the Bose store in SOHO.  Without the benefit of speaking to their reps and trying the products, I probably would have just bought the $125 regular headphones (which is why I'm sharing my review with you all who may not have a Bose store where you are).  These are pricey but an investment.  I'm really looking forward to creating a sanctuary for myself and tuning out in my QC3's.After using this product a bit longer, if there are any negatives, I'll be sure to provide an update.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My decision to go with the QC 3 instead of QC2 (or another brand entirely)", "unixReviewTime": 1216252800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2008"}

But, I also experienced the sucking sensation others have mentioned in the QC3.  This was in my right ear and it felt like I had to keep popping my ear.  In that sense, the Brookstone pair was much better.In addition, the Brookstone headphones felt better on my ears.  It seemed to have softer ear pads.

The nib lays a Western fine line, and, in keeping with the tradition of its inspiration, is stiff as a nail; don't expect any swooping calligraphy here. That said, it is an almost tediously reliable starter, and pleasant enough writer, if a bit on the scratchy side (this is mostly a matter of aesthetics; it has little impact on the writing itself). For this reason, I am skeptical about the description's claim of a gold-plated nib. The small portion that protrudes from the hood does not look particularly gold-like to me, but I have not disassembled then pen to make sure. If I ever do, I shall update the review, but it writes well enough that I am not overly concerned.All in all, a solid, solid pen. The wine red barrel is gorgeous, though a bit thin in places (for example, the feed is a visible discoloration through the hood. From a distance, it could easily be mistaken for a genuine Parker, even bearing a no doubt copyright-infringing Parker Arrow clip. In hand, it is lighter, but still feels good between the fingers.As a final note, I will say that after I first inked the pen, I did notice a few drops of ink on the hood, perhaps spatter from the nib, perhaps a leak in the sac.

I loved Fight or Flight and was hoping there would be a sequel.  When I saw Sink or Swim I thought it was the rest of Jay and Em's story and was sad to see it was not (though that was a great book also)  I don't know how it missed this one since it has been out for a few months, but I am so glad I found it.Fight or Flight is on my favorites list, so I would love anything that had to do with Jay and Em.  When they 'rode off into the sunset' in the end of Fight or Flight, it was obvious that life was not going to be easy.  Two teenagers, who have lived very trouble lives are going to have struggles and hardships trying to make it on their own.I do have a few complaints about the story that make it 4 stars, rather then 5.**Spoilers**The middle of the story gets pretty repetitive.  Too much time is spent in Jay and Em's heads while they think about how terrible they are and how they are not good enough for eachother.  It is important to see what is going on in their heads to understand why they are doing what they are doing, but it just too much and too repetitive.It also took Jay too long to have his moment of clarity.  What he was trying to do was understandable, but he should have figured out that it was not working much sooner.  There were too many times when he would  run to Em's rescue, apologizing for not being there for her, and then leave still thinking he was protecting her.  It became clear very early on that Em was going to be a target and be in danger, whether she was with Jay or not.  He just made it harder to protect her by keeping her away. It did not make sense that he could not figure that out.  I could see him not realizing the emotional damage he was doing  because of his low self esteem, but I just did not get how he could not figure out that having her living with Ashlyn was just putting both of the girls in more danger, by leaving them on their own to fend off his crazy dad.While the middle of the book dragged on a bit and starting getting repetitive the ending was kind of rushed.  We only 'saw' the big climax though Em's point of view and never got to see how Jay was feeling after the ordeal with his father and he and Em finally being intimate.  We are told that everything is explained to Mason, but don't get to experience it.  I would have liked to experience Mason's thoughts and reactions to learning Jay and Em's story.  He had to have had a lot of questions about why Em had so many issues and why such young people had such an intense relationship.  It would have been nice to see his reaction to finally understanding everything.There are side characters introduced in the story, but we don't learn anything about them.  Em talks about being a bad friend and she is right.  Ashlyn goes out of her way to help Em and most of the time she gets brushed off or completely ignored.  Ashlyn and Mason are getting their own story, but I have no idea what it will be about, because we don't learn anything of substance about them in this book.  All we know about them is that they are both nice, live off their parents and work in a crappy restaurant.  We are told that Mason is 19, but never even find out how old Ashlyn is.  She lives on her own in a house, or maybe and apartment,  with a spare room that her dad pays the rent for.  We don't know if she goes to school or anything about her life outside of work and her friendship with Em.  We aren't told if Mason has his own place or lives at home.  His parents bought his car and he seems to have not shortage of money, so it does not really make sense that he is waiting tables in a nasty restaurant.  You would think he could find a much better job.The story ends with room for yet another book.  I will be happy if there is more in store for Jay and Em, but I would not want to see more relationship drama for them.  They have been though enough and their love and relationship should be solid.  I would love to see them working together side by side, to get past their demons and build their future.  I would want whatever drama any future books would have to be things they could face together and not things that would tear them apart.If there is not going to be another book for them, I will be disappointed with how this one left off.  There could have been less of the back and fourth in the middle of the book and more closure to their story.I am a huge fan of the whole Fight or Flight saga.  I am sure I am being nit picky in my review, but that is just because I love the characters so much and have been spending months thinking about them and imagining what their future would be like.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "So exciting to have more of Jay and Em!", "unixReviewTime": 1396224000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2014"}

Not so!  That model does a fabulous job and the wire clips keep the curler in place nicely.Now for this new set... I bought the smaller roller set because I recently cut my hair for the  spring/summer so the larger diameter set doesn't really have enough hair to hold in nicely.  I thought these would be perfect.Not so.Although flocked like the larger - fast heating as well (crazy fast!) - the plastic clips I wanted for the larger do not hold at all in my hair.  I have enough hair - it is on the medium/thick side, I don't 'over-load' or 'under-load' the curler but the clips just do not hold.  They flop around on your head instead of staying in place. and you wind up with weird loose curls (if you get any at all) that have dents in them - not a good sight!Not happy with this item at all and it is going back.  I sent them a message on fb but no hopes of hearing anything.A better clip system is needed.EDIT:  Call 1-800-3CONAIR and tell them you purchased this set and the clips are terrible if you are not happy with them but rather then return the whole set - would they please supply you with the metal version of the clips that fit this model.  The number for the clips is CHV26IVR-clips.  They only cost $1.50 and .50 for shipping so they actually just sent them for free.Now for the review with the new clips: tried them with the meal clips - and they are awesome so a 3 star review went to 5 stars for both the curlers (which heat up CRAZY fast, the flocking also keeps them from tangling in your hair when you take them out) and for Conair's customer service (I think it is in Mexico because I called twice, I accidentally hung up the first time) and both times they were different women but both Spanish accents).These curlers are perfect for my mew shorter summer hair cut.

She has a great boyfriend, Clayton Greene, a loyal best friend, Jenny, and an odd acquaintance with a cute college guy named Kevin. The down side is that Beth was tricked (earlier in the year) into becoming a vampire. Then she had to save Clayton from dying by changing him into a vampire as well. Kevin is a vampire hunter. The only reason Kevin has not staked them both is because they have yet to drink the blood of a LIVING person. Until such time, Beth and Clayton may still have a chance to become human again. To do so, they must figure out WHO Beth's maker/master is and then have the vampire staked.Jenny is using her journalism skills to investigate students, teachers, and anyone else from the school in hope that the list of possibilities (suspects) can be narrowed down. Once trimmed to a decent size the hard part will begin. Jenny, Beth, Clayton, and Kevin must test the rest with holy water.Of course there are major hurdles in the way. Someone, or a group of people, are trying to stake Beth into dust. Beth has just dodged an arrow from a crossbow when she overhears Clayton talking on the phone. And it definitely sounds like Clayton has hired someone to assassinate Beth so he can become human again. After all, Beth is Clayton's maker. Taking advantage of the romantic strain, Kevin is trying to win Beth's love and doing a very good job of it. There is also the fact that Beth stopped trying to figure out the day-walking formula for the higher up vampires of the school and it looks like they will have to force Beth to begin work on the formula anew. Lastly, there is another vampire clan in town; the Traditionalists. They do not want the day-walking formula to be found. If that means getting rid of Beth and anyone else in their way, then so be it.***** If you missed the first book (The Good Ghoul's Guide To Getting Even) then run, don't walk, to the nearest book store and buy a copy! No, you do not HAVE to read the first book in order to enjoy this novel, but things will make a bit more sense to you if you do. Beth is smart, highly self-motivated, and very witty. Okay, sarcasm comes naturally to her, but that just makes her more realistic to readers, right? I am also very excited, because it LOOKS like there will be a third story to this undead adventure.

The tent and air mattress: great! The lantern: terrific! The stove: not too good.We did not have the problem that many others seem to have had; namely, an aluminum tray that catches and is not secured to the base properly. And, as with older models, the design is a winner -- adjustable wind flaps, and folding and carrying that are well-thought out (as long as you are able to carry the portable propane tanks separately).BUT, the raison d'etre of a stove is .... HEATING. You cannot control the flame on this thing. No matter how precisely you adjust the flame, no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob, the flame immediately goes to high. It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob. This was okay when we wanted to boil water, but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant. This was true on both burners.Coleman should be ashamed. Is this the start of the demise of the Coleman reputation? Surely the company knew about this before these went out to the public. I won't be so quick to assume a Coleman product is good quality anymore. Of all the things to get wrong!

La Peri has always been a favorite of  mine and it was well played here by the BBC with just the right amount  of mysticism combined with suspense .. The Sorcerer's apprentice was also wonderfully done approaching the right amount of tension.Many critics call Paul Dukas' almost fifty minute piano sonata to be on of the best in the Twentieth Century. He combines the effort of Bethovian style with French pianistic style. The CDs contain a wonderful performance by Margaret Fingerhut who while not a visionary t the piano does manage to be able manage the overalls  shape of the sonata in a way that brought tears to with Dukas' massivel beautiful work.I highly recommend these CD since Paul Dukas was not a one-hit composer.Please excuse typos I have a neurologic disease.CD!72.21 c=CD2", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well done performances", "unixReviewTime": 1228694400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2008"}

{"reviewerID": "A2C5MGWRRAD7N2", "asin": "0520075455", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "A fascinating book that tries to understand how and why some young secular Jewish women are drawn to more orthodox religious communities which reinforce more traditional gender-definitions, and also, how these women are resocialized according to the norms of these communities. In using an ethnographic approach, the advantage her study offers is that we get not only retrospective accounts of these women's stories, but we also can \"experience the contexts, ideas and relationships that led [these] women to be converted\" (p. 50). In addition, she notes that \"a case study that pays close attention to a specific experience--even an exceptional one--reveals patterns and designs that pervade the larger picture as well\" (p. 27). So through her study she hopes to be able to shed some light on not just a few individuals who return to traditional / strict forms of religion, but \"on the more general question of the nature, status, and appeal of religion in modern society,\" and \"what religion offers modern secular individuals\" in general (p. 27). These are important questions that a comparative ethnographic approach can address that quantitative variables-based approaches simply can't.From reading the accounts of her participants, it seems that these women turn to traditional religion because they are unable to fit into conventional social scripts for people in their situation. These interviews were done in the early-80s; these women were in their mid-30s, single, wanted families, weren't strongly attached to their careers, and were going through some experience of crisis or loss, so they needed order and meaning. But one could argue that as more social scripts and role-models develop over time (e.g., `Sex and the City' etc.), there will be narratives for them to fit into which will further reduce the need for such people to turn to religion, unless religion can somehow provide a more compelling alternative to even these now-available forms of order and meaning. This argument could be further strengthened by the fact that many of these women seemed to be seeking self-understanding and a sense of identity, so much so that what seemed to matter to them more was \"the powerful feelings of belonging and of being part of an ongoing community\" rather than religious experience or actual faith (p. 103). It would be good to investigate whether such `belonging without believing' can persevere over time (e.g., does `belonging without believing' in stricter religious communities eventually lead to frustration/burnout? Is it possible for the question of `right belief' to become more important over time in such contexts?, etc.)An interesting point she brings up is the \"wisdom of interviewing people who are at a transitional stage in their lives\" (p. 60). One concern she tries to address here is dealing with the vulnerability of people whose identities are in a state of flux. But another question might simply be to what degree are people who undergo religious conversions adequately capable of articulating why it is they are doing what they are doing? I would think such accounts would also change over time depending on sustained reflexivity, the nature of interlocutors, and so on. So it would really take something like a longitudinal study, assessing people's accounts over time, to gain better insights into such phenomena.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great example of comparative ethnography", "unixReviewTime": 1339718400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2012"}

I have fine, randomly wavy, color-treated hair and my hair stylist recommended the Bio Ionic OnePass for several reasons. It does a nice job adding shine into hair, and it also can be set at lower temperatures for fine, color-treated hair. I only used this flat iron at the lowest setting (240 degrees) and I almost always used a heat protectant spray before flat ironing. The good news is that at 240 degrees, it worked amazingly well. I really only needed one (or at most 2) passes through the hair, and my hair was definitely shinier than pre-flattening. (Also, note that this iron also needs to move slowly through the hair, and the silicone strips create a friction that will tug/pull the hair at the scalp if you pull it through the hair too quickly-so don't!)My hair looked really fantastic for the first two or three weeks of daily use with this iron, but after that, I noticed some drying/damaging/extra frizz, so I decided to use it only every other day or less. I know this is a great product for many hair types, and it's a favorite product of my stylist. For my hair type, it does work well, but despite all its ions and silicone strips, I still definitely needed to use the heat protect spray, and limit myself to every other day. In the end, I decided to go back to getting another Brazilian treatment (love, love, love it) to avoid the need for using styling products and further stress on my fine hair. Now I use this flat iron only once a week or less when I need more styled looking hair, and I'm happy with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very nice for fine hair when used at lower temperatures", "unixReviewTime": 1370304000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2013"}

First, the clips that are supposed to hold the rollers in one's hair are totally unsatisfactory for that purpose.  They do nothing to hold the hair to the roller and leave a crease in your hair if they do. The only way to keep them in your hair is to wear a snood/hair net over the rollers.  Not a good look. The slit in the rollers that is supposed to let the \"ions\" out, often catches hair as you remove the roller and then you have to CAREFULLY extricate the hair from the slot.  The ribs on the ends of the rollers are minimal and curlers often slip out of my hands and fly across the room. Yes, I'm \"beauty\" challenged, but I bet there are a fair number out there just like me.  So far, none have broken, so kudos for sturdy.  Lastly, the assortment of sizes is silly. I need the large rollers and the small ones are purely a waste; someone needing the small ones, would have no use for the largest.

No, not most of them, or a vast majority - every one. It was a hell of a show, while it lasted, and it provided great exit music for Ferrari's departure from sports car racing after the 1973 season.Like most racers of the era, the eleven copies built were born out of necessity, emerging head first through a loophole that had closed tightly on larger displacement cars like the Porsche 917 and Ferrari's own 512. Suddenly, three liters was the ceiling - and a weight of at least 650Kg was the floor. That put Porsche out to sea; the closest machine they had was the 908/3, which was too light by some 220 pounds. Adding the ballast they'd need to classify would sorely tax their 370-horsepower air-cooled flat-eight engine. So, Porsche's factory sports racing program toodled out of sight, shedding 908s to privately owned teams as they went.It would have been a massacre, even if the Stuttgart boys had shown their faces: the 312PB carried upwards of 460 horsepower and an alarming 11,800RPM redline, all housed in an aerodynamic shape with foils at the rear and a scooped, sloping nose. With five speeds on tap, and a driver roster including Brian Redman, Jacky Ickx, Mario Andretti, Tim Schenken, and Arthuro Merzario, the car's F1-derived drivetrain and almost 200 mile per hour top speed laid down the law against the likes of Matra, Alfa Romeo - and those weighed-down 908s then in the hands of privateers.Like the 1:18 330P4 that GMP modeled as the debut car in its \"Masterpiece Collection\" series, this latest scale wonder is an amalgam of media, all carefully - and it would seem, wisely - chosen to bring out not just the shape of the 312PB, but its feel. Lessons learned about working with stamped metals have been remembered well; the body on this late-process pre-production sample is wrought from diecast that follows the swoops and sweeps of the real racer's form perfectly. It all fits together beautifully, and most of the seams are dead-on straight. Most importantly, the areas at the leading and trailing edges of the shell have been narrowed and formed to replicate the thinned-down profiles inside the wheel wells and at the rear. That makes for a perfect mix of mass manufactured smarts and hand-built visual finesse.That mix is an impressive one, and it's aided on the outside by slick and thoughtful detailing: the metal pin hinges for the swing-up doors, for instance, are scaled very well, and they're sturdy; metal \"fasteners\" are at the corners of the clear headlight covers, and rivet detailing is cast into the panels in all the right places, under the paint and tamped-on decorations. That rosso corso finish is lustrous and polished, and the model has the low, liquid look of the 312 on gold wheels sprouting metal valve stems and simulated balance weights.This version  - the car that Mario Andretti and Jacky Ickx won the 1972 Six Hours of Daytona in - will be the first release in the series, and the much-handled sample we're seeing here has been bounced from place to place. But it's still tight, straight, and well joined on display. And that's saying something - the model breaks out into a rolling frame with only a couple of simple, relatively drama-free maneuvers. Tug the rear upwards and free the pins at the base of the roll bar to bring the back off; grab the nose right where the prancing ponies decorate the area below the fuel fills, and lift to separate it from the frame. Done.Well, not exactly. The model boasts a mega-piece build, and the chassis carries the majority of the castings, extrusions, and textiles on the packing list. Once denuded, the frame shows off giant, scuffed tires at the rear and all the intricate suspension elements that keep them square; each corner is fully functional against steel coil springs, with articulated, screwed-in joints and flexible hoses. The wheels are pullable, too. I used a shop tweezer to do the deed, but I'd reckon that GMP will supply a suitable tool to remove the central lug on regular order models. Once clear, the hubs are neat, with full on brake caliper and rotor detailing and plumbing.Then comes the tricky stuff: lift the panel above the footwell and you can gander at the pedals and bracing below - as well as the hair-thin wiring and piping festooning the binnacle. The seats are covered in a blood red textile that looks good and follows the forms well, and the saddles are flanked by twin tanks wearing photoetched sealing rings. Wanna have fun? Tickle the shifter - all 1/8 inch of it - through its detents, and futz around with the woven seat harnesses.Beneath a secondary lift-off panel and behind the pass-through radiators lies the 180-degree V12, considered as such because of the way its pistons traveled - not in opposition, as in a boxer, but in unison. Stashed into the rearmost struts of the semi-monocoque frame, GMP's built in a highly detailed image of the Mauro Forghieri design, with metal screens set over the air boxes, and all manner of braces and rods cris-crossing the valleys and peaks of the engine's base castings. Toward the front, the complex throttle linkages are surrounded by the fuel lines and ignition leads; out back, over and around the en bloc transmission, GMP's wound struts, rods, springs, links, half shafts and bracing through to decorate and round out the Ferrari's final drive components. My favorite bit of business is the quadruple bazookas slung beneath the model; these white exhaust trumpets are the terminations of a mad mass of piping below the car, and they`re held in place by very neat bracket castings and steel springs.This is a truly great model car that shows a new level of detail, and commitment to same, from this maker - and a new direction I can only hope they stay the course on. My biggest quandary - and one I'll have to revisit once the production version comes to market - is how to display the car. Assembled, it's a beauty that can catch your eye from across the room. With the body pieces removed, it becomes a mesmerizing, enjoyable puzzle of detail and modeling finesse.You know what? That sounds like a win-win to me. - CRM", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Season in the Sun: GMP's Ferrari 312PB in 1:18", "unixReviewTime": 1273104000, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2010"}

Hunter", "helpful": [17, 69], "reviewText": "The main trouble I have with Nietzsche is that he is so blasted illogical!  Most of his errors are what logician call &quot;informal fallacies,&quot; or error with the type of inferences he makes with his data.To his credit, Nietzsche is a very bouncy, scintillating an energetic writer.  I think that many people can learn from his literary style.  I certainly have.  But a well-perfumed lie is like a well-perfumed skunk: eventually both will stink, since you cannot change their nature no matter how pretty you make them up to be!Here are some samples of hi errors:P. 56.  &quot;Let us consider finally what naivety it is to say 'man ought to be thus and thus.'&quot;  In other words, we ought not say ought.  See the internal incoherency?Ibid. &quot;We others, we immoralists, have on the contrary open wide our hearts to every kind of understanding, comprehension, approval.&quot;  Has he opened his heart wide to accept religion or God?  This, by the way, is called &quot;dicto simplicter,&quot; or a sweeping generalization; and it is also an &quot;iron man&quot; argument, where you overstate your own position.P. 64.  &quot;The error of free will. --We no longer have any sympathy today with the concept of 'free will.&quot;  One you remove freedom, you remove meaning.  If Hitler, Dahmer, or whom ever wasn't free to choose not to become incarnate devils, then we cannot hold them accountable.  We do not blame blind people for being born blind because they simply have no control over that condition.  But we do have an ability to control our own souls, to make gods and angels of ourselves, or to make demons and devils of ourselves.  If we have no freedom, then we have no penal system, simply the criminal could not control his or herself.  And that would be hell on earth.Ibid.  &quot;Men were thought of as 'free' so that they could become guilt.&quot;  This is probably a Freudian Slip on Nietzsche's part.  Religion has a cutting edge to it--always repent and do not make excuses for your meanness.  We get so concerned about the evil in the world around us; we forget the evil deep within us.P. 66. &quot;One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves beyond good and evil--that they have the illusion of moral judgments beneath them.&quot;  It is good to be beyond good.  It is moral to be beyond morality.  In other words, Nietzsche assumes what he tries to disprove.The only reason why I think Nietzsche's philosophy caught on is that first, he was a bouncy and vibrant voice.  I enjoy reading his works because they are rather witty and quick and slicing.  Secondly, his philosophy is very flattering one.  God is dead; you become the Superman and replace God (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, ch. 24).  This unctuous punch has made many people punch drunk with lust.  A very appealing idea that you can become a new god by yourself, which is the oldest lie in the Book!The Anti-Christ:Being a Christian does not dampen or deny my ideas, being biased against the conclusion, any more than an atheist is tainted, being biased in favor of the conclusion.  Bias cuts both ways.It is true, and no one doubts this, many abuses have been in the name of religion.  But is it fair to judge a thing by its abuse?  Shall we judge all Austrians by the abuses of Hitler? Do we throw out Mozart with the bathwater?  No.  Nietzsche makes yet another &quot;dicto simplicter&quot; in accusing Christians of being unworthy.As I read his treatment of Christianity, I kept asking myself, &quot;What religion is he talking about?&quot;  It seems that Nietzsche is describing Christianity in the worst possible of terms, as if he intentionally wants to misunderstand what the religions is about.  It is like the genies or fairy that play syntax-games with the wishes they grant human beings--&quot;Make me a sandwich!&quot;  *Poof!*In conclusion, I find Nietzsche an engaging, fun and passionate writer.  We have so man wet noodles out there; it is great to read some one with a backbone.  However, Nietzsche falls apart miserably with his non-existent logic.  And that is a deathblow.The Book:This is a great \"two-fer,\" since both books are rather slender and trim books.  Penguin Classics always does a superb job with these books-the introductory essays are helpful and the notes are useful.  They type is excellent and there are no typos.  I found the glossary of names in the back an added plus, since I am not up to speed on may of the German philosophers and Nietzsche's time period.

The author gives a lot of detail and drama so that you feel like you are living their romance. We get illuminating glimpses of William's upbringing, from the tragic nature of his parent's marriage to the way Diana made William her confidante. You feel a lot of sympathy for William who had to go through such stress at an early age. The chapter on Kate's background centered on her social climbing mother and grandmother, and her love for William even before they met each other. After they meet a lot of what goes on involves William's various flings, lots of drinking and partying and expensive shenenagans, Kate's patience and protectiveness when it comes to William. We witness her rising stature with her increasing acceptance with the royal family, the way she dealt with the paparazzi, how she tried to balance a life of her own with having a relationship with William. Along the way we are taken for a ride with all the trappings of their privileged lives: elite prep schools, exotic vacations, grand estates and hunting parties, designer clothes, ascots, polo, fame and constant dealings with the press, formal functions, ubiquitous security and paparazzi. It is fun and decadent and a little surreal. In addition, we also learn a lot about the monarchy and the events and scandals that have shaped it.The book gave me some distinct impressions of the two young people themselves. William seems like a rather immature stereotypical white male with little self-awareness about his privilege. In his college years he was always groping females at parties and emerging in the early hours drunk. (Maybe in Britain that's normal behavior). To his credit he did well academically. He was totally careless of how he spends money, racking up thousands of dollars in one night at a bar, or taking joy rides on helicopters adding up to $100,000 of tax payer's money. Even while he was in an established relationship with Kate, his behavior with other women roused all kinds of speculation. He would leave her for weeks at a time, show up with his ex-girlfriend, and gave new meaning to the title of boyfriend-who-strings-you-along-for-years-and won't-make-a-commitment. It makes you wonder that if he were not Prince would Kate really put up with him for such a long time.Kate, out of love or ambition or both, showed herself quite determined and clever in her pursuit of the Prince. She was willing to overlook every foible, endure every neglect, humiliation, as well as hassle from the paparazzi. She was helped in no small part by her family. Originally intending to attend Edinborough University, Kate switched to St. Andrews at the last minute at her mother's urging to be closer to William. She worked her way into his inner circle of friends and became one of three people selected to be his roommate the second year, and the only girl. After they graduated, her parents bought her a million dollar condo in London so she could stay in the game. She hired an image consultant to pick out her wardrobe and worked out to maintain her figure. She made sure that she would never be photographed drunk or disheveled. Her discretion and attractiveness won her favor with the royal family and the public. She made herself charming to her future in-laws and got them to include her in their outings, even when William wasn't around. She didn't pressure him about getting married or try to censor him. During their brief breakup, she made sure to be photographed looking very attractive and having fun with other men. The fact that she became Duchess of Cambridge at last is in no small part due to her patience and resourcefulness. When I look at the pictures of them during their courtship, she looks like the more mature one who knew exactly what she's doing. They love each other no doubt, and really clicked in terms of personality. But I get the feeling that it's really Kate's determination that made it work.From this story, one learns a lot about the art of pursuing a man. Show up, but don't be too forward. Look attractive, be calm, be cool, be charming. Don't act desperate. Be patient and forebearing. Win over his family and friends. Have a life of your own. Be fun and don't try to get too serious too soon. Be strategic. Enjoy the ride.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The art of pursuing a man", "unixReviewTime": 1345766400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2012"}

We had 9 kids under 60 lbs climbing and sliding for hours. I love the size of the pool and that the &#34;ladder&#34; they climb is located within the pool...which reduces the kids wanting to get in and out and track in dirt/grass. It is surprisingly sturdier than I expected. I (130 lbs) tried to climb up the &#34;ladder&#34; and the top leaned my way. But once I was on top it straightened up without problem. I suggest stick to the weight limit. For the party we put multiple tarps to cover the dirt/non-smooth ground and that protected the bottom of this item.

While both worked well, the Quiet Comfort 3 is now in the shop, needing a $80 rennovation.  The Sennheiser, well, takes a beating and keeps on ticking.Problem with Quient Comfort 3 - I travel a lot, and use it on long flights about 3 times a month.  About 3 months ago, the head phone generated a loud and sharp high pitch noise when I pressed the headphone a little closer to the ears (getting that feeling of closer fit).  After being examined by Bose, I was told this would cost about $30 bucks to fix.  Not so bad.As I spoke with the service staff and asked if they can also replace the padding, which has been worned out a bit.  I was told $50 was the magic number to get it fixed.  The lady agreed with me that customers complain about this issue, and have reflected this point to head office.  Guess what, head office didn't do anything about it, as I was told.  Frankly, using it 3 times a month for 3 years is not exactly that much, even if it's for a max of 20 hours worth of flights (I dont use this head phone at home).  This equates to about 45 min a day.  There are many months when I don't even use it.  My Sennheiser noise cancelling and 480 have seen much used for home entertainment and on the trains, and no problems at all!To add insult to injury to the now $80 USD tab.  I asked what if I don't want it fixed - frankly, I might as well buy a new pair.  The lady told me there is a service charge just to examine the unit - which the store rep didn't tell me at all!  I told them to keep my head phone.  They should keep it... if I should develop hearing problems due to the high pitch sound, at least they can keep the evidence.Mark", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not bad if it works.  1 year warranty is too short for this very delicate and potentially hazardous product", "unixReviewTime": 1287273600, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A2E3F04ZK7FG66", "asin": "B00007I6FP", "reviewerName": "calvinnme", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "Although it seems tame compared to the show's currently on television (most notably \"The Shield\"), \"NYPD Blue\" was groundbreaking back when it premiered in 1993. It was one of the first television shows to truly push the envelope, featuring nudity, violence, and language that you thought you'd never hear on network television at the time. So much so, that it wasn't even broadcast on the ABC affiliate in Dallas during that first season.The first season contains some quality television moments. I found the pilot disappointing - it's dull prime time fare meant primarily to shock the viewer. However, the second episode will draw you in. Sipowicz, after being shot by a mobster, lies in the hospital while his partner, Detective John Kelly (David Caruso) and other precinct characters, seek revenge. The internal affairs stuff becomes more relevant, as does Sipowicz's nasty drinking habit, his disastrous personal life and his racist tendencies. Kelly is more of a kinder cop, standing behind his partner even with his bad habits, and Caruso plays it with such debonair coolness in contrast to Franz's gruff Sipowicz that he attracted movie offers quickly and left after the first four episodes of the second season. Unfortunately, people remember more about how Caruso's career went downhill after he left the show than just how good he was at playing Kelly.Remember that besides the shock value, season one of NYPD Blue is depicting a pre-Giuliani New York City - one in which people carry spare watches and extra cash so that when they inevitably get mugged they have something to give the robber and don't get pistol whipped. This inevitable sense of victimhood is personified in \"4B\" (David Schwimmer), a guy who is mugged in the laundry room of his own apartment building, starts carrying a gun, and is eventually killed while trying to defend himself against a subsequent attack. There's also the budding \"Beauty and the Beast\" romance between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas which begins Sipowicz' transformation into a good and admirable person. Then there is the season-long epic of officer Janice Licalsi (Amy Brenneman) who kills a mobster who in turn wanted her to kill John Kelly and was threatening to reveal her late father's corrupt past as a police officer as leverage. Licalsi has apparently gotten away with a crime that seems somewhat justifiable, but her conscience just won't let the deed rest.Overall, I would say that this was one of the better seasons of NYPD Blue. The characters were much more interesting than they were in later seasons and the stories were pretty good, although I was somewhat bored by the internal affairs material. The season holds up over time, but the shock value really doesn't, and in some cases actually does damage to character development. For example, there is really no reason for that last scene of the last episode of the season between John Kelly and Robin, the widow of John's rich friend who has recently died of cancer. In fact, subtract the shock value, and it makes Kelly look like a real jerk - Licalsi is facing prison for saving John's life and his first act after her confession and arrest is to be with another woman? In spite of it all, I would still recommend the DVD set since this first season really is very unique among the twelve season run and is a must for any true fan of the show.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First season was the best and the most unique", "unixReviewTime": 1162598400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006"}
